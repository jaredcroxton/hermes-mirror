# The Scroll-Film Playbook (Lane B, cinematic footage)

Hard-won rules for making the whole page one continuous generated film. These are a floor, not a ceiling: break them knowingly, never by accident. The KIE route is primary for CREW builds (section 4); the Higgsfield route is the documented alternative (section 5); any image-to-video engine that accepts a start image runs the same chain contract with only the generate, wait, and download calls swapped.

## 1. Footage-first law

The film is the source of truth; the website is a player. Design the camera arc first (one continuous journey, about 5 chapters), then build the page around whatever footage actually comes back. Never storyboard the site and force footage to match: footage drifts, copy is cheap to move.

## 2. Chaining law (flawless joins)

**FIRST, check whether the whole film fits in ONE generation.** If the engine's maximum duration covers the film you pitched, generate it as a single clip and skip chaining entirely: a single generation has no junctions, so there is nothing to gate, nothing to repair, and no seam can exist. Seedance 2.0 standard accepts durations up to 15s (361 frames at 24fps, a perfectly respectable scrub payload); the KIE v1-lite route tops out at 10s (241 frames), enough for a short film or an embed placement. Measured receipt: after four failed chaining attempts on one brief, a single 15-second take (start pinned to the opening keyframe, end pinned to the final keyframe, the WHOLE journey written as one continuous move) produced the first genuinely continuous film of the session, first time, approved on sight, and cost less than the seamed attempts it replaced. Write the prompt as one unbroken sentence-chain through every chapter ("begins on X, falls past Y, continues down to Z, lands in W") and say "one single unbroken shot, no cuts, no edits, continuous camera move throughout" explicitly. **Chaining is the compromise, not the default**: reach for it only when the journey genuinely cannot fit the duration cap.

When you do chain: each clip's start image is the ffmpeg-extracted literal last frame of the previous clip. Not a lookalike keyframe, the actual pixels:

```bash
ffmpeg -sseof -0.05 -i clipN.mp4 -update 1 -q:v 1 clipN-last.png
```

KIE route: upload `clipN-last.png` via the base64 file endpoint and pass the hosted url as clip N+1's `image_url` (`scripts/kie.py` does this per link in the chain).

Higgsfield route:

```bash
higgsfield generate create seedance_2_0 --prompt "..." \
  --start-image clipN-last.png --duration 5 --resolution 1080p \
  --mode std --generate-audio false
```

Only the opening keyframe (nano-banana) starts the chain; every later start image is a real last frame. Keep one continuous camera direction the whole way (always descending, or always pushing in); reversals read as cuts. Uniform clip length gives constant scrub speed.

## 3. The junction gate (measured, never eyeballed)

```bash
ffmpeg -i A-last.png -i B-first.png -lavfi ssim -f null - 2>&1 | grep All
```

- At or above 0.88: pass. 0.80 to 0.88: watch it in motion before judging. A true fail is structural.
- SSIM under-reads on stochastic texture (clouds around 0.66, embers around 0.72, liquid caustics around 0.60 can all be seamless). The number says where to look; the side-by-side decides. Production evidence: the reference forge build's junctions measured 0.71 to 0.83 and every one was seamless in motion, because sparks, smoke, and caustics are stochastic.
- The number one real failure is grade or geometry drift (an invented sunrise, a new horizon). Fix by regenerating with: "Continue the exact same shot from the reference frame, identical framing, identical colour grade. Do not change the colour grade."
- Dissolves and crossfades over a bad junction are forbidden. The scrub lets the user park on the seam, which exposes the mask instantly. Fix the join, do not hide it.

## 4. The KIE route (primary, verified by a shipped build)

The verified REST contract:

- Create task: `POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask` with `{model, input}`, returns `data.taskId`.
- Poll: `GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=...`; `data.state` is `success` or `fail`, result urls in `data.resultJson.resultUrls`.
- Upload a local frame for chaining: `POST https://kieai.redpandaai.co/api/file-base64-upload` with `{base64Data: "data:image/png;base64,...", uploadPath, fileName}`, returns `data.downloadUrl`.
- Credit balance: `GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/chat/credit`. Quote the cost before generating; report the balance delta after (the receipt).
- Keyframe model: `google/nano-banana`. (`nano-banana-pro` returns 422 on some keys; fall back silently.) Input: `{prompt, output_format: "png", aspect_ratio: "16:9"}`. About 4 credits per image.
- Clip model: `bytedance/v1-lite-image-to-video`. Input: `{prompt, image_url, resolution: "720p", duration: "5", camera_fixed: false}`. About 22.5 credits per 5s 720p clip.
- v1-lite is single-seed only (no last-frame anchor), so the chain contract is: ffmpeg-extract the literal last frame of clip N, upload it, use the hosted url as clip N+1's `image_url`. The same chaining law as section 2.
- **720p IS the master tier on this route.** Frames ship at about 1280px wide and 720p is 1280x720 native, so there is no draft-and-master split here; the Higgsfield draft-cheap-then-master flow does not apply.
- Transient KIE 500s and server-side fails happen: retry the same create up to 4 times, 12 seconds apart.

A full five-chapter film (one keyframe plus five 720p clips, with uploads) ran 139 credits end to end and passed every gate.

## 5. Billing truths, Higgsfield route (verify by balance delta, not docs)

- `--generate-audio false` is THE cost lever. Audio ON silently multiplies the bill by about 3.
- Measured price ladder per 5s clip (confirm with `higgsfield generate cost`): 1080p/std about 45, 720p/std about 22.5, 720p/fast about 17.5, 480p/fast about 7.5. A 10s clip is twice a 5s.
- Draft the whole chain at 480p/fast to validate, then re-run only the approved prompts at 1080p. A regen at draft tier costs a fraction of a full one.
- About 15% of jobs fail server-side with no reason and do not bill. Just retry the same call.

## 6. Keyframe prompt law (letterbox bars)

nano-banana bakes letterbox bars into cinematic prompts. They survive cover-fit and show on 16:9 viewports. Every keyframe prompt must end with: "Full-bleed full-frame image, no letterbox bars, no black bars, no borders, no text, no watermark, no logo." Avoid the word "anamorphic" (it invites bars).

## 7. The bright-ending law

Final clips drift bright. A closing chapter prompted to "fade toward darkness" can come back as a lit room. The regen that works stacks explicit darkness language: "pitch-black", "all lights dimming", "the frame gradually darkening until almost everything is pure black", "no bright room, no visible ceiling lights". Budget one regen for the final clip; it carries the seam handoff into the after-film content.

## 8. Assembly

- Concat dropping the duplicate junction frame (`select='gte(n,1)'` on clips 2 and up), and always `-fps_mode vfr` on the master encode. Default CFR sync pads about 5 duplicate frames per junction, which reads as frozen scrub zones.
- Extract every 2nd frame to about 300 JPEGs at about 1280px, `-q:v 4`. (Dark, grainy footage nearly doubles JPEG bytes; 1280 at q4 keeps the payload light without visible loss at cover fit.)
- Sample the final frame's edge colour: that hex is the seam for the film-to-content handoff.

`scripts/assemble.sh` does all of this and prints the frame count. Set FRAME_COUNT to exactly that number in the engine; never guess it.

## 9. The scrub engine (why it is jank-free)

- Canvas plus pre-extracted JPEGs, never `<video currentTime>` scrubbing (seek stutter).
- ImageBitmap sliding window: `drawImage(HTMLImageElement)` forces a synchronous JPEG decode on first paint (and again after cache eviction), and that decode spike IS the frame-by-frame jank. `createImageBitmap` decodes off-thread; keep a window of decoded bitmaps around the playhead (about 18 ahead, evict and close beyond about 28) so every draw is a pure GPU blit.
- Lerp the frame index (`current += (target - current) * 0.14`) for butter. Cap DPR at about 1.5.
- **Lerp the playhead, but SNAP when the gap exceeds about 12% of the film** (fast flicks): a lerp-only playhead sweeps every intermediate frame and the decode storm freezes the page. Snap to 8 frames short of the target, lerp the rest (see engine.md, snap-on-big-gap).
- Lenis smooth scroll; a concurrency-capped image pump; a `nearestFrame()` fallback so a missing frame never blanks the canvas.
- Measure jank with rAF deltas (p95 and max), never average fps. Target max under 50ms. Production evidence: 301 frames at 1280w with the DPR cap measured avg 16.7ms, p95 27.3ms, max 30ms over 873 rAF frames; the first cold run showed one 276ms spike (cold decode) and warm runs were clean. Run the jank test twice before believing a spike.

## 10. Chrome, seam, and the ambient layer

- Adaptive header: sample the drawn frame's top strip luminance (about every 180ms) and toggle an `.on-light` class. Fixed chrome over a changing film cannot be one hard-coded colour.
- Seamless handoff: start the next section's background gradient at the sampled final-frame colour. No visible line between film and content.
- Ambient hero layer (optional, free): sprite-based canvas particles themed to the world (snow glisten, gold pollen, embers) over the static first frame, fading out across the first 7% or so of scroll, so the hero feels alive before the scrub starts. Use one offscreen radial-gradient sprite and `drawImage` per particle (never `shadowBlur`); stop rendering entirely at alpha 0; skip under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Film grain plus vignette sell the one-shot feel; fade both out with the handoff.

## 11. Verification harness

Host preview panes throttle hidden tabs (rAF freezes, so screenshots go stale). The reliable path is puppeteer-core plus system Chrome plus a page dev contract:

- `?jump=<scrollY>`: land pre-scrolled and force-settle all scroll state.
- `window.__ready = true` only after frames are decoded and settled.
- Capture: goto, waitForFunction(__ready), wait about 1200ms, screenshot. Shoot every beat position AND every junction. Hide any cursor-follower until the first real mousemove or it photobombs captures at 0,0.
- On macOS, serve from a /tmp copy: TCC blocks preview servers reading Desktop paths, so copy index.html plus assets and frames to /tmp and serve there.

`scripts/verify.js` does capture plus the jank test.

## 12. Governance

Design taste and design code are done by the Claude model only. Mechanical steps (ffmpeg, SSIM, puppeteer, vercel) are pure code, no model. Quote credits before spending; show the balance-delta receipt after. One continuous shot, one world per brand.
