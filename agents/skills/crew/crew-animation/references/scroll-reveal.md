# Scroll reveal spec (consulted via crew-animation)

A scroll reveal is the lightest kind of scroll animation: an element starts hidden (or offset and transparent) and animates once to its resting state when it enters the viewport, one-shot and IntersectionObserver-first rather than scrubbed frame-by-frame to the scrollbar. This spec covers the reveal pattern and its transform-and-opacity composite, the distances and durations, the stagger and cascade, any parallax, the observer thresholds and rootMargin, the library choice (or no library), the performance, and the reduced-motion path.

## When to use scroll reveal

Do not use this spec for a scroll-scrubbed cinematic teardown or a pinned timeline where motion tracks the scrollbar frame-by-frame (that is `crew-animation-gsap` with ScrollTrigger, or `crew-animation-locomotive` for the smooth-scroll layer), for physics-based or gesture-driven motion (`crew-animation-spring`), or for state-driven component motion in React where variants and layout transitions matter (`crew-animation-motion`). A scroll reveal is enter-the-viewport reveal: lightweight, IntersectionObserver-first, one-shot. The moment the motion must scrub continuously with scroll position rather than fire once on entry (a parallax that moves the whole time you scroll, a pinned scene, an image-sequence scrub), name the scrub tool and route there; this spec covers the reveal, not the scrub.

## What a spec needs

You need:

- The motion brief: what should reveal, why it reveals (a hero entrance, a feature grid, a content section coming into view), and on what trigger (the element entering the viewport, almost always).
- The context: the elements involved, whether they reveal as a group (a grid, a list) or one at a time, the framework (vanilla, React, a static marketing page), and whether a library is already loaded.
- The accessibility constraint: that reduced-motion must be honoured (always), that content must be readable even if the observer never fires, and what the resting (revealed) state is.

If the brief is too vague to spec (no idea what reveals or why), ask once what should reveal, why, and as a group or one at a time. Never invent a reveal the brief did not call for, never spec a reveal that leaves content invisible when JavaScript fails, and never animate a layout property where a transform achieves the effect.

## How the scroll-reveal animator thinks

1. **A reveal is one-shot and binary, not a scrub.** The element is hidden, then it enters the viewport, then it animates once to its resting state and stays there. There is no per-frame mapping to scroll position. If the motion needs to move continuously as you scroll, it is a scrub, and it belongs in a scrub tool, not here.
2. **The observer is the primitive, the library is optional.** IntersectionObserver is native, runs off the main thread, and reports when an element crosses a threshold without any scroll listener. Most reveals need nothing more than an observer plus a CSS class toggle. Reach for AOS or Sal only for the convenience of an attribute-driven API, and for GSAP only when the reveal is actually a scrub in disguise.
3. **Transform and opacity, always.** A reveal animates `opacity` and a `transform` (`translateY`, `translateX`, `scale`, `rotate`, or a `filter: blur`), composited and cheap. Animating `top`, `height`, or `margin` to reveal triggers layout and drops frames. This is the floor, not an optimisation.
4. **Content must survive without JavaScript.** The resting state is the default; the hidden state is applied by a class the observer adds and removes. If JS fails or the observer never fires, the content must still be there and readable. A reveal that hides content by default and reveals it only with JS is a content-availability bug, not a style choice.
5. **Fire once, then unobserve.** A reveal that re-triggers on every entry flickers and wastes work. The native fire-once mechanism is to call `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` inside the callback after the first reveal (or `observer.disconnect()` when all are done) so each element reveals a single time and the observer stops watching it. (`once: true` is an AOS.init() flag, a Sal data-attribute, or an addEventListener option, NOT a native IntersectionObserver option; for a plain observer call `unobserve()` after the first intersection.)
6. **Respect the user.** Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, the reveal collapses to an instant appearance (opacity only, no translate, no blur) or no animation at all. Motion that ignores reduced-motion is an accessibility failure. Stagger stays subtle so a long page does not feel like it is loading forever.

## Reveal patterns

The vocabulary of an enter-the-viewport reveal: a hidden state, a resting state, and a composited transition between them. The hidden state pairs `opacity: 0` with one transform; the resting state is `opacity: 1` with the transform cleared. The observer toggles a single class.

```css
/* Resting state is the default so content survives without JS */
.reveal { opacity: 1; transform: none; transition: opacity 0.6s ease-out, transform 0.6s ease-out; }
/* Hidden state, applied by JS only once the observer is set up (or via a .js class on <html>) */
.js .reveal:not(.is-visible) { opacity: 0; }
.js .reveal-up:not(.is-visible)     { transform: translateY(24px); }
.js .reveal-left:not(.is-visible)   { transform: translateX(-32px); }
.js .reveal-right:not(.is-visible)  { transform: translateX(32px); }
.js .reveal-scale:not(.is-visible)  { transform: scale(0.96); }
.js .reveal-rotate:not(.is-visible) { transform: rotate(-3deg) scale(0.98); }
.js .reveal-blur:not(.is-visible)   { opacity: 0; filter: blur(8px); }

/* Reduced-motion override: neutralize BOTH the transform/filter AND the transition, not just opacity */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .reveal, .js .reveal:not(.is-visible) { opacity: 1 !important; transform: none !important; filter: none !important; transition: none !important; }
}
```

- **fade-up** (the workhorse): `opacity 0 to 1` plus `translateY(16 to 32px) to 0`. The most common reveal; content rises a short distance as it fades in. Keep the distance small (16 to 32px); a large translate reads as a slide, not a reveal.
- **slide-in from a side:** `translateX(-32 to 32px) to 0` with opacity. Pairs left and right for alternating content sections. Keep the distance modest so the element does not appear to fly across the screen.
- **scale-in:** `scale(0.96 to 0.98) to 1` with opacity. A gentle grow. Never start from `scale(0)`; that reads as a pop and exaggerates the easing.
- **rotate-in:** a small `rotate(-3 to 3deg)` combined with scale and opacity, for a card or image with a touch of personality. Keep the angle small.
- **blur-in:** `filter: blur(8px) to 0` with opacity, for a soft focus-in. Blur is more expensive than transform, so use it sparingly and on few elements, not a whole grid.
- **Duration and easing:** 400 to 800ms is the reveal range (600ms is a safe default). Use an ease-out (`ease-out` or `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`) so the element decelerates into place. Transition only `opacity, transform` (and `filter` for blur), never `all`.

## Stagger and cascade

A group of elements should not all reveal at the same instant; a small delay between them creates a cascade that guides the eye. The stagger is a per-element delay, applied as `transition-delay` or set in the observer callback by index.

```javascript
// Cascade by index: each element reveals a beat after the previous
const STAGGER = 80; // ms between elements; keep small so the page does not crawl
const items = document.querySelectorAll(".reveal");
const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries, obs) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (!entry.isIntersecting) return;
    const el = entry.target;
    const i = Number(el.dataset.index || 0);
    el.style.transitionDelay = `${i * STAGGER}ms`;
    el.classList.add("is-visible");
    obs.unobserve(el); // fire once
  });
}, { threshold: 0.15 });
items.forEach((el, i) => { el.dataset.index = i; io.observe(el); });
```

- **Stagger amount:** 60 to 120ms between elements feels alive without dragging. Above ~150ms a long list feels like it is loading slowly. Cap the cumulative delay so the last item is not absurdly late; reset the index per row or per batch rather than running one ever-growing delay down a hundred-item list.
- **Batch by row, not all-at-once and not one-by-one down the whole grid.** A grid should reveal row by row: items in the same visual row share a delay, the next row reveals after them. Computing the row from the element index and the column count keeps the cascade reading horizontally then down, which matches how the eye scans, instead of a single diagonal sweep across the whole grid.
- **Direction of cascade:** the delay order sets the direction. Index order cascades top-left to bottom-right; reverse the index for the opposite. For a centred reveal, order by distance from the centre element. Match the cascade direction to the reading order and the visual hierarchy (the hero element first).
- **Group reveal versus per-element:** when a tight cluster should feel like one unit (a single card's title, body, and button), reveal the container once and let CSS `transition-delay` on the children stagger inside it, rather than observing each child separately.

## Parallax reveals

Parallax moves layers at different speeds to suggest depth: a background drifts slower than the foreground, so the scene reads as having a near plane and a far plane. The key distinction for this skill is between a reveal and a scrubbed parallax, and most true parallax is a scrub.

- **A reveal with depth:** as a section enters, a background layer settles in from a slightly larger offset and a foreground from a smaller one, both one-shot. This is still a reveal (it fires once on entry) and belongs here. Use different translate distances and a slightly longer duration on the back layer to fake depth on the way in.
- **A scrubbed parallax:** the layers move continuously the entire time the section is in view, their positions mapped to scroll progress frame-by-frame. This is not a reveal, it is a scrub, and it belongs in `crew-animation-gsap` (ScrollTrigger with `scrub` and `ease: "none"`) or under a `crew-animation-locomotive` smooth-scroll layer with `data-scroll-speed`. Do not try to fake a continuous parallax with an IntersectionObserver; the observer only knows entry and exit, not the position in between.
- **The test:** does the depth effect happen once as the section arrives (a reveal, here), or does it track the scrollbar the whole way through (a scrub, route it out). When in doubt, if the brief says "moves as you scroll" it is a scrub; if it says "settles in" or "comes into view" it is a reveal.
- **Speed differential:** for the reveal-with-depth case, the back layer travels a larger distance over a longer duration (for example `translateY(48px)` over 900ms) and the front a smaller one (`translateY(16px)` over 600ms), so the back appears to lag. Keep the differential subtle; a large gap looks broken, not deep.

## Intersection Observer

The native primitive, and the no-library path that most reveals should use. IntersectionObserver watches elements and calls back when their intersection with the viewport (or a root) crosses a threshold, all off the main thread, with no scroll listener.

```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries, obs) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      entry.target.classList.add("is-visible");
      obs.unobserve(entry.target); // reveal once, then stop watching
    }
  });
}, {
  threshold: 0.15,            // fire when 15% of the element is visible (0 to 1, or an array)
  rootMargin: "0px 0px -10% 0px", // shrink the root box from the bottom so reveals fire once the element has risen meaningfully into the viewport (later, higher), not earlier
  root: null,                 // null means the viewport; pass a scroll container for a scrollable panel
});
document.querySelectorAll(".reveal").forEach((el) => observer.observe(el));
```

- **threshold:** a number 0 to 1 (or an array of them) setting how much of the element must be visible before the callback fires. `0` fires the moment any pixel enters; `0.15` to `0.25` is a good default for a reveal so it fires when the element is clearly on screen but before it is centred. An array (`[0, 0.5, 1]`) fires at each crossing, useful for progress, overkill for a one-shot reveal.
- **rootMargin:** a margin (CSS syntax) that grows or shrinks the root's bounding box before intersection is computed. A negative bottom margin (`0px 0px -10% 0px`) delays the trigger until the element is further up; a positive margin (`200px 0px`) triggers early, before the element is on screen, which is good for prefetching or pre-warming a reveal. Use it to tune when, not whether.
- **once versus every:** for a reveal, fire once. The native observer has no `once` option (it accepts only `root`, `rootMargin`, `threshold`, `scrollMargin`, `delay`, and `trackVisibility`); `once: true` is an AOS.init() flag, a Sal data-attribute, or an addEventListener option, NOT a native IntersectionObserver option. For a plain observer, call `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` (or `observer.disconnect()` when all are done) inside the callback after the first intersection so the element does not re-reveal and flicker on every scroll past. Only keep observing if the design genuinely wants the element to animate out and back in, which is rare and usually a mistake.
- **root:** `null` is the viewport (the common case). Pass a scrollable element as `root` when the reveals live inside a scrolling panel rather than the page itself.
- **The no-library path:** an observer plus a class toggle plus a CSS transition is the whole reveal. It is a few lines, has no dependency, runs off the main thread, and is what the large majority of reveals should use. Add a library only for the ergonomics of an attribute-driven API or when the motion is really a scrub.

## Library comparison

The honest weight-and-control tradeoff. Pick the lightest tool that does the job.

- **Plain IntersectionObserver (no library):** zero bytes added, native, full control, runs off the main thread. The right call for almost every custom reveal, especially a single-file build or a performance-sensitive page. The cost is that you write the few lines of glue (observer, class toggle, CSS) yourself, which is trivial.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** a small attribute-driven library, ~14KB JS (~8KB gzipped) plus a required ~26KB stylesheet (a few KB gzipped), with a `data-aos` attribute API and 50-plus built-in fade, slide, zoom, and flip presets. The right call when you want reveals configured in HTML with no JavaScript glue, on a marketing or content page, and the convenience is worth the bytes. It is CSS-driven and GPU-accelerated. Call `AOS.init({ once: true })` and `AOS.refresh()` after DOM changes. It is not for scrubbed or pinned motion.
- **Sal.js:** a tiny (~2.8KB gzipped) alternative to AOS with the same attribute-driven `data-sal` idea but a fraction of the weight, built on IntersectionObserver. The right call when you want the attribute-driven ergonomics of AOS but care about every kilobyte. Sal covers the core fade, slide, zoom, and flip presets but a smaller set than AOS, and lacks some of AOS's anchor-placement and per-element config ergonomics; choose Sal when weight matters more than preset breadth. Same boundary: attribute-driven reveals only, not scrubs.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger:** the heavyweight (GSAP core plus the ScrollTrigger plugin, together roughly ~25 to 30KB gzipped), and the right call only when the "reveal" is actually a scrub, a pin, a scrubbed parallax, an image-sequence, or a choreographed timeline tied to scroll position. For a plain one-shot reveal it is overkill; GSAP can do `once: true` reveals, but you would not pull in the library for that alone. Route scrub work to `crew-animation-gsap`.
- **The decision:** simple attribute-driven reveals go to AOS or Sal (Sal when weight matters most); a lightweight custom reveal goes to plain IntersectionObserver (the default); scrubbed, pinned, or timeline-tied motion goes to ScrollTrigger via the GSAP skill.

## Anti-patterns

```
Over-reveal where every element on the page animates       -> reveal what earns it (sections, hero, key cards); a page where everything moves feels cheap and slow.
Scroll-jacking or hijacking native scroll                  -> a reveal enhances scroll, it never seizes or traps it; the user scrolls normally and elements appear.
Content invisible without JavaScript                       -> the resting state is the default; the hidden state is applied by a JS class, so content survives if JS fails or is slow.
Re-revealing on every scroll past (flicker)                -> fire once: unobserve the element after the first intersection (the native observer has no once option; once: true is an AOS / Sal flag).
Animating top, height, or margin to reveal                 -> animate transform and opacity (and filter for blur); they skip layout.
A raw scroll-event listener instead of an observer         -> IntersectionObserver runs off the main thread and reports entry without thrashing.
No reduced-motion path                                     -> under prefers-reduced-motion, collapse to instant appearance (opacity only) or no animation.
A stagger so large the page crawls                         -> keep the per-element delay 60 to 120ms and cap the cumulative delay; reset per row or batch.
Faking a continuous parallax with an observer              -> the observer only knows entry and exit; a continuous parallax is a scrub (crew-animation-gsap).
Content that never appears if the observer never fires     -> guard with a fallback (reveal on load, or a no-JS resting state) so nothing is permanently hidden.
Above-the-fold element stays hidden on first paint         -> with threshold greater than 0 a partially-visible-on-load element can report isIntersecting false and stay hidden; use threshold 0 for above-the-fold reveals, an on-load pass that reveals anything already intersecting, or scope the .js hidden class to below-the-fold elements only.
```

## Application rules

The checklist a build embeds when its animation section says to reveal on scroll.

```
[ ] The motion is a one-shot reveal (fires once on entry), not a scrub tied to scroll position.
[ ] The trigger is IntersectionObserver (or AOS / Sal), never a raw scroll-event listener.
[ ] Only transform, opacity, and (sparingly) filter animate; no top, height, or margin.
[ ] Each element reveals once: the element is unobserved after the first intersection (or, with AOS / Sal, their `once` flag is set; the native observer has no `once` option).
[ ] Content is readable without JavaScript; the resting state is the default, the hidden state is applied by a class.
[ ] The reveal distance is small (16 to 32px translate, 0.96 to 0.98 scale), the duration 400 to 800ms, ease-out.
[ ] Groups stagger 60 to 120ms and cascade by row, not all-at-once and not one ever-growing delay.
[ ] Any continuous parallax is routed to a scrub tool; only reveal-with-depth stays here.
[ ] A reduced-motion path collapses motion to an instant appearance under prefers-reduced-motion.
```

## Speccing workflow

1. **Read the motion brief.** Name what should reveal, why it reveals, and as a group or one at a time. If the brief is too vague to spec, ask now. If the motion must scrub continuously with scroll position (a pin, a continuous parallax, an image-sequence), route it to `crew-animation-gsap` or `crew-animation-locomotive` and stop.
2. **Choose the pattern and the trigger.** Pick the reveal pattern per element or group (fade-up, slide-in, scale-in, rotate-in, blur-in) and confirm the trigger is the element entering the viewport. Decide the library: plain IntersectionObserver (the default), AOS or Sal for an attribute-driven API, and route scrub work out.
3. **Spec the reveal composite.** Name the hidden state and the resting state (opacity plus one transform, or filter for blur), the distance (16 to 32px translate, 0.96 to 0.98 scale), the duration (400 to 800ms), and the ease-out. Confirm the resting state is the default so content survives without JS.
4. **Spec the stagger and cascade, and any parallax.** For a group, set the stagger (60 to 120ms), the cascade direction, and the batch-by-row rule with a capped cumulative delay. For depth, decide reveal-with-depth (stays here, different distances and durations per layer) versus a continuous parallax (route to the scrub tool).
5. **Spec the observer and the performance.** Set the threshold (0.15 to 0.25), the rootMargin (to trigger early or late), `root` (viewport or a panel), and the unobserve-after-fire rule. Name the transform-and-opacity floor and the no-scroll-listener rule.
6. **Spec the accessibility path.** Name the reduced-motion path (collapse to an instant appearance, opacity only, under prefers-reduced-motion), the no-JS fallback (content readable, a load-time reveal or no-JS resting state), and confirm nothing is permanently hidden if the observer never fires. For elements that may already be in the viewport on first paint, avoid the above-the-fold no-fire trap: use threshold 0 for above-the-fold reveals, OR run a one-time on-load pass that reveals anything already intersecting, OR scope the `.js` hidden class only to below-the-fold elements. (`observe()` does deliver an initial callback, but with threshold greater than 0 a partially-visible-on-load element can report `isIntersecting: false` and stay hidden.)
7. **Write the spec and run the anti-pattern check.** Assemble the scroll reveal spec, and confirm none of the anti-patterns are present (over-reveal, scroll-jacking, content invisible without JS, re-reveal flicker, layout properties, no reduced-motion, a fake continuous parallax).
8. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm the motion is a one-shot reveal, the trigger is an observer, only transform and opacity animate, each element fires once, content survives without JS, the cascade is sensible, and the reduced-motion path exists. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
SCROLL REVEAL SPEC
Brief: a marketing page, the hero copy fades up on load, a three-up feature grid cascades in as it enters, alternating content sections slide in from the sides   Trigger: element enters the viewport   Framework: vanilla   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Library:
- Plain IntersectionObserver. The page is a single file and performance-sensitive; an observer plus a class toggle plus a CSS transition is the whole reveal, no dependency.

Reveal patterns:
- .hero h1 / .hero p: fade-up, translateY(24px) to 0, duration 700ms, cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1). Resting state default; .is-visible clears the offset.
- .feature-card (3): fade-up, translateY(20px) to 0, duration 600ms, ease-out.
- .section .content: slide-in, translateX(-32px) (left) and 32px (right) to 0, duration 700ms, ease-out.

Stagger and cascade (if a group):
- Feature grid: stagger 90ms by index, reading order left to right; one row so no row-batching needed, cumulative cap 270ms.

Parallax (if any depth):
- None. (A continuous background parallax was discussed and routed to crew-animation-gsap as a scrub; it is not a reveal.)

Observer:
- threshold 0.2, rootMargin "0px 0px -8% 0px" so reveals fire once the element has risen meaningfully into the viewport (later, higher, more centered), not earlier, root null (viewport), unobserve each element after its first intersection.

Performance and accessibility:
- Only opacity and transform animate; no scroll listener; each element fires once.
- Reduced-motion: under prefers-reduced-motion, all reveals resolve to opacity 1 with no translate and no transition (instant appearance).
- No-JS fallback: the resting state is the default in CSS; the hidden state is gated behind a .js class on <html>, so with JS off everything is visible and readable.
```

## Guardrails

- Never spec a continuous, scroll-tracking motion here. A reveal fires once on entry; anything that scrubs with scroll position (a pin, a continuous parallax, an image-sequence) belongs in `crew-animation-gsap` or `crew-animation-locomotive`. Name the tool and route it.
- Never leave content invisible without JavaScript. The resting (revealed) state is the default; the hidden state is applied by a JS-added class, so content survives if JS fails, is slow, or the observer never fires.
- Never re-reveal on every scroll past. Fire once: `unobserve` the element after its first intersection (the native observer has no `once` option; `once: true` is an AOS / Sal flag, not a native IntersectionObserver option), so it does not flicker.
- Never animate a layout property (top, height, margin) to reveal when a transform achieves the effect. Transform and opacity (and filter for blur, sparingly) are the floor.
- Never drive a reveal with a raw scroll-event listener, and never scroll-jack. IntersectionObserver reports entry off the main thread; native scroll is preserved.
- Never ship without a reduced-motion path. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the reveal collapses to an instant appearance (opacity only, no translate, no blur). This is mandatory, not optional, and it is the accessibility floor for this skill alongside content-without-JS.
- Never over-reveal (every element on the page animating) and never invent a reveal the brief did not call for. Reveal what earns it.
- No AI-slop in the spec: no "make it pop", no filler, no emoji. Exact patterns, distances, durations, thresholds, and stagger values.
- If a project playbook exists (a motion system, an approved reveal set, a performance budget), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the spec build skills read when their animation section says to reveal content on scroll: `crew-web-slide-deck-builder`, `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder`, and any marketing or content page build. Hand them the scroll reveal spec to implement.
- Route a scroll-scrubbed teardown, a pinned timeline, an image-sequence, or a continuous parallax to `crew-animation-gsap` (ScrollTrigger), and the smooth-scroll-plus-parallax layer to `crew-animation-locomotive`; a one-shot reveal cannot scrub.
- For physics-based or gesture-driven motion route to `crew-animation-spring`; for state-driven component motion (variants, layout, exit) in React route to `crew-animation-motion`.
- Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel and motion polish at the component level (the exact easing curve, the distance that feels right); this skill owns the reveal pattern and the observer wiring.

## Verification

Before the spec is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The motion is a one-shot reveal (fires once on entry); any scrub or pin was routed to crew-animation-gsap or crew-animation-locomotive
[ ] The trigger is IntersectionObserver (or AOS / Sal), never a raw scroll-event listener
[ ] Only transform, opacity, and (sparingly) filter animate; no top, height, or margin
[ ] Each element reveals once: it is unobserved after the first intersection (or, with AOS / Sal, their `once` flag is set; the native observer has no `once` option)
[ ] Content is readable without JavaScript; the resting state is the default, the hidden state is applied by a class
[ ] The reveal distance is small and the duration is 400 to 800ms with an ease-out
[ ] Groups stagger 60 to 120ms and cascade by row with a capped cumulative delay
[ ] A reduced-motion path collapses motion to an instant appearance under prefers-reduced-motion
```
