# CSS animation spec (consulted via crew-animation)

CSS animations, CSS transitions, and the Web Animations API (WAAPI) are the lightest, most portable motion path on the platform: no library, no bundle cost, no framework, just the browser's own animation primitives, running off the main thread when the motion sticks to transform and opacity. This spec covers the keyframes or transition, the shorthand and longhands, the fill mode, the WAAPI control surface (element.animate(), play, pause, reverse, the finished promise) when JS is needed, the compositor-only performance, and the reduced-motion path.

## When to use CSS animation

Do not use this spec for complex multi-step sequencing and orchestrated timelines (that is `crew-animation-anime` or `crew-animation-gsap`, which own the timeline and relative offsets), for state-driven React component motion with variants, layout, or exit animation (`crew-animation-motion` is more idiomatic), for physics-accurate, gesture-driven, velocity-preserving motion (`crew-animation-spring`), or for scroll-driven reveals (`crew-animation-scroll-reveal`). CSS is the lightest, framework-independent, no-dependency path: CSS keyframes and transitions for motion that describes its end state and for state motion, WAAPI for JS control without a library. Name the heavier tool when the work needs orchestrated timelines or dynamic runtime values across many elements, where the native primitives turn into a pile of hand-managed delays.

## What a spec needs

You need:

- The motion brief: what should animate, why it moves (a state change, a reveal, a loop, a hover, a generated sequence), and on what trigger (state toggle, hover or focus, load, in-view, a JS event).
- The context: that the motion is light enough to live in the platform (no orchestrated timeline or library state), the elements involved, and whether it is a transition (state change), a keyframe loop, or a JS-driven WAAPI animation.
- The accessibility constraint: that reduced-motion must be honoured (always), and what the reduced or instant state should be.

If the brief is too vague to spec, ask once what should animate, why, and on what trigger. Never invent a motion the brief did not call for, never animate a layout property where a transform achieves the effect, and never reach for JS where a CSS transition would do.

## How the CSS animator thinks

1. **The platform first.** CSS keyframes and transitions are the lightest motion on the web: no bundle, no dependency, native engine. If the motion is describe-the-end-state, a state change, or a single-element loop, the platform already does it. Reach for a library only when the work outgrows the primitives.
2. **Transition for state, keyframes for a loop.** A transition animates the gap between two states the element actually has (a hover, a class toggle, an attribute change). A keyframe animation runs a defined sequence on its own, looping or one-shot, independent of any state change. Pick by whether there are two states or a self-running sequence.
3. **Transform and opacity, always.** These two properties animate on the compositor, off the main thread, with no per-frame layout or paint (the layer is painted once, then only composited each frame). Animate `transform` and `opacity`; `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, and `margin` force layout on every frame and stutter. This is the floor under every animation skill.
4. **Fill mode decides the held state.** Without a fill mode, the element snaps back to its unanimated style before and after the run. `forwards` holds the end, `backwards` applies the start during the delay, `both` does both. A seeked or settled animation needs `both` so the held state is correct.
5. **CSS until you need JS, then WAAPI before a library.** When the motion needs dynamic values, playback control, sequencing, or a promise to chain on, WAAPI gives the native engine a JS handle (element.animate(), play, pause, reverse, finished) with no dependency. Reach for a library only when WAAPI is not enough (orchestrated timelines, many coordinated elements, runtime-computed values everywhere).
6. **Finite, purposeful, and accessible.** Loops are finite or earn their infinity (a deliberate, lightweight motif), never an idle drain on battery and the main thread. Every motion has a `prefers-reduced-motion` path that removes or reduces it. Native does not mean exempt from the accessibility floor.

## CSS keyframes

A `@keyframes` rule defines named stops; the `animation` property binds it to an element and runs it. This is the tool for a self-running sequence (a loop, a one-shot entrance) that does not depend on a state change.

```css
@keyframes pulse-ring {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.82); }
  35%  { opacity: 1; }
  to   { opacity: 0; transform: scale(1.18); }
}

.pulse-ring {
  /* shorthand: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state */
  animation: pulse-ring 1200ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1) 0s 3 normal both running;
}
```

- **Keyframe stops** are percentages (`0%` to `100%`); `from` and `to` are aliases for `0%` and `100%`. Several stops can share one rule (`0%, 100% { ... }`). Any property declared inside a stop is animated; properties absent from a stop interpolate from the surrounding stops.
- **The shorthand** packs the longhands in order: `animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state`. The longhands are `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`, `animation-fill-mode`, and `animation-play-state`. Set them individually when only one needs to change (for example a per-element `animation-delay` for a stagger).
- **animation-iteration-count** is a number or `infinite`. Keep it finite and computed from the need unless an infinite loop is a deliberate, lightweight motif.
- **animation-direction** is `normal`, `reverse` (run the keyframes backward), `alternate` (forward then backward each cycle), or `alternate-reverse`. `alternate` is how a ping-pong loop avoids the jump back to the start.
- **animation-fill-mode** is `none` (default, no style held outside the run), `forwards` (hold the last keyframe after it ends), `backwards` (apply the first keyframe during the delay), or `both`. Use `both` when the animation must hold its state before and after running.
- **animation-play-state** is `running` or `paused`; toggling it (often from JS or a class) pauses and resumes without resetting progress.

Stagger without duplicating keyframes by driving the delay from a custom property:

```css
.dots span { animation: dot-pop 900ms ease-out both; animation-delay: calc(var(--i) * 120ms); }
/* <span style="--i: 0"></span><span style="--i: 1"></span> ... */
```

## CSS transitions

A transition animates the change between an element's current computed value and a new one when a property changes (a hover, focus, a toggled class, a changed attribute). There are no keyframes; the browser interpolates the two endpoint values.

```css
.card {
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 0.9;
  /* shorthand: property duration timing-function delay */
  transition: transform 220ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1) 0s, opacity 220ms ease 0s;
}
.card:hover { transform: translateY(-6px); opacity: 1; }
```

- **transition-property** names what transitions (`transform`, `opacity`, or `all`; prefer naming the exact properties over `all`, which can transition unintended changes and cost performance). **transition-duration**, **transition-timing-function**, and **transition-delay** set the timing; the `transition` shorthand lists them per property, comma-separated for several properties.
- **The difference between a transition and an animation.** A transition needs a state change to fire and only ever runs between two values (start and end); it cannot loop or define intermediate stops. A keyframe animation runs on its own with no state change, can loop, and can define many intermediate stops. Use a transition for hover, focus, and class-toggle state motion; use a keyframe animation for a self-running or looping sequence.
- A transition only animates a property whose values are interpolable and that actually changes; transitioning to or from `display: none` does not work directly. The opacity-and-visibility trick handles fade-out (the element is still in the layout while it fades), but it cannot animate enter from `display: none`, since the element has no prior computed value to interpolate from. That is exactly why `@starting-style` with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` exists, and it is the modern recommended path for both enter and exit.

## WAAPI

The Web Animations API runs the same native engine as CSS but from JavaScript. `element.animate(keyframes, options)` creates and plays an `Animation` and returns it, so you can drive timing from data and control playback without a library.

```js
const orb = document.getElementById("orb");
const animation = orb.animate(
  [
    { transform: "translate3d(-160px, 0, 0) scale(0.8)", opacity: 0 },
    { transform: "translate3d(0, 0, 0) scale(1)", opacity: 1, offset: 0.35 },
    { transform: "translate3d(120px, 0, 0) scale(1.08)", opacity: 1 },
  ],
  { duration: 3000, delay: 200, easing: "cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)", fill: "both", iterations: 1 },
);

animation.pause();              // playback control on the returned Animation
animation.play();
animation.reverse();
animation.finished.then(() => { /* runs when the animation completes */ });
```

- **The keyframe array** is a list of objects (`{ transform, opacity, offset }`); `offset` (0 to 1) places a frame explicitly, otherwise frames spread evenly. An alternative top-level format is a single object of arrays (`{ transform: ['translateX(0)', 'translateX(100px)'], opacity: [0, 1] }`), where each property is an array of values across the run. The two formats are mutually exclusive: use the array-of-objects form above or the object-of-arrays form, not a mix of arrays and scalars inside one form.
- **The options object** mirrors the CSS longhands as camelCase: `duration` (ms, animation-duration), `delay` (animation-delay), `easing` (animation-timing-function), `iterations` (a number or `Infinity`, animation-iteration-count), `direction` (animation-direction), and `fill` (use `"both"` so the held state persists, animation-fill-mode). Separately, `endDelay` is a WAAPI-only EffectTiming option with no CSS counterpart (a pause after the run completes, used for sequencing), and `iterationStart` likewise has no CSS equivalent. `element.animate()` is the convenience form; `new Animation(new KeyframeEffect(el, keyframes, options), document.timeline)` is the explicit construction it wraps, useful when you want to build the effect before playing it.
- **The Animation object** carries the controls: `play()`, `pause()`, `reverse()`, `cancel()` (stop and clear effects), `finish()` (jump to the end), the `playbackRate`, the `currentTime` (read or set to seek), and the `finished` and `ready` promises. `animation.finished` resolves when the run completes, which is the clean way to chain a next step without a timeout.
- **The document timeline.** Animations are timed against `document.timeline` by default. `document.getAnimations()` returns every running animation on the page (including CSS-declared ones promoted to `Animation` objects), so you can pause, seek, or inspect them collectively.
- **Composite modes.** `composite` (`replace`, `add`, `accumulate`) controls how a keyframe value combines with the element's underlying value, so two animations on the same property can layer instead of one overwriting the other. `replace` is the default.
- **Why WAAPI.** Reach for it when CSS keyframes are too rigid: dynamic, data-driven values, real playback control (play, pause, reverse, seek), a promise to chain on, or generated animations from structured data, all with the native engine and zero dependency. It is the step between CSS and a library, not a replacement for an orchestrated timeline.

## Performance

- **Compositor-only properties.** `transform` and `opacity` animate on the compositor thread, off the main thread, with no per-frame layout or paint (the layer is painted once, then only composited each frame). Animate these. `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, and `padding` trigger layout (reflow) on every frame and stutter; `box-shadow`, `background`, and `color` trigger paint. Translate instead of moving with `top`/`left`, scale instead of animating `width`/`height`.
- **will-change, sparingly.** `will-change: transform` hints the browser to promote an element to its own layer before it animates, which can smooth the start. Apply it only to elements about to animate, and remove it when the motion stops; leaving it on many elements wastes memory and can hurt more than it helps.
- **contain.** `contain: layout paint` (or the `content` shorthand, which also adds style containment) on an animating subtree limits how far the browser must recompute layout and paint, isolating the work to that element.
- **Avoid layout and paint thrash.** Do not animate a layout property, and do not interleave reads (`offsetWidth`, `getBoundingClientRect`) with writes in a JS loop, which forces synchronous reflows. Batch reads, then writes.
- **The 60fps budget.** Each frame has about 16ms (about 8ms at 120Hz). Compositor-only animations meet it because they skip layout and paint; a layout-triggering animation blows it and drops frames.
- **Off the main thread.** A `transform`/`opacity` CSS animation, and the equivalent WAAPI animation, run off the main thread, so they keep moving smoothly even while JavaScript is busy. This is the central reason to stay on the two compositor properties.

## CSS vs JS boundary

The call is which native primitive fits, and when the work has outgrown the platform.

- **CSS keyframes or transitions are enough when:** the motion is describe-the-end-state, a state change (hover, focus, a toggled class), a self-running loop, or a simple entrance. No JS is needed; the browser runs it natively and the spec is a stylesheet. This is the default; reach past it only with a reason.
- **WAAPI (JS, no library) is needed when:** the values are dynamic or data-driven, you need real playback control (play, pause, reverse, seek, change rate), you must sequence steps or chain on completion (the `finished` promise), or the animation is generated from structured data. WAAPI gives the native engine a JS handle without any dependency.
- **A library is the right call when:** the work needs an orchestrated timeline with relative offsets and labels (`crew-animation-anime`, `crew-animation-gsap`), scroll-scrubbed or pinned choreography (`crew-animation-gsap`, `crew-animation-scroll-reveal`), state-driven React component variants, layout, and exit motion (`crew-animation-motion`), or physics and gesture (`crew-animation-spring`). When you find yourself hand-managing a web of delays and coordinated states across many elements, the platform has been outgrown; name the library.

## Anti-patterns

```
Animating left, top, width, height, margin            -> animate transform (translate, scale) and opacity; layout properties reflow every frame.
Animating box-shadow, background, color in a loop      -> these trigger paint; fake a shadow with an opacity-animated pseudo-element, or accept the cost on a one-shot.
An infinite loop with no purpose                       -> keep iteration-count finite unless the loop is a deliberate, lightweight motif; an idle infinite loop drains battery and holds a layer.
No animation-fill-mode where state must hold           -> use fill-mode both so the start and end states persist before and after the run.
transition: all                                        -> name the exact properties (transform, opacity); all transitions unintended changes and costs performance.
A janky, non-composited animation                      -> if it stutters, it is almost certainly animating a layout or paint property; move to transform and opacity.
will-change left on everything                         -> apply will-change only to elements about to animate, and remove it when they stop.
JS where a CSS transition would do                     -> a hover or class-toggle state change belongs in a CSS transition, not a JS animation loop.
Reaching for WAAPI.finished to mutate critical DOM at the wrong time -> the promise is for chaining; do not hang render-critical state on a timer or a stray rAF clock.
No reduced-motion path                                 -> gate the motion behind prefers-reduced-motion and remove or reduce it.
```

## Application rules

The checklist a build embeds when it uses native CSS or WAAPI motion.

```
[ ] The platform is justified: describe-the-end-state, state, or single-element loop motion, not an orchestrated timeline or library-state job.
[ ] Only transform and opacity animate; no layout property (width, height, top, left, margin) and no paint property in a loop.
[ ] A transition is used for a state change (hover, focus, class toggle); a keyframe animation is used for a self-running or looping sequence.
[ ] animation-fill-mode (both) holds the state where it must persist; iteration-count is finite unless an infinite motif is deliberate.
[ ] WAAPI is used only when JS control is needed (dynamic values, playback control, sequencing, the finished promise), with fill both.
[ ] will-change is applied only to animating elements and removed on stop; contain isolates the subtree where it helps.
[ ] The motion holds the 60fps budget (compositor-only, off the main thread); no read-write layout thrash in any JS loop.
[ ] A prefers-reduced-motion path removes or reduces the motion to a static or minimal state.
```

## Speccing workflow

1. **Read the motion brief.** Name what should animate, why it moves, and on what trigger. Note whether it is a state change (a transition), a self-running loop or entrance (keyframes), or a JS-driven, data-driven, or playback-controlled motion (WAAPI).
2. **Confirm the platform fits.** If the work needs an orchestrated timeline or relative offsets, route to `crew-animation-anime` or `crew-animation-gsap`; if it is scroll-scrubbed, route to `crew-animation-gsap` or `crew-animation-scroll-reveal`; if it is state-driven React component motion, route to `crew-animation-motion`; if it is physics or gesture, route to `crew-animation-spring`. Only proceed when CSS or WAAPI is the right, lightest tool.
3. **Choose the primitive.** Decide between a CSS transition (a two-state change), a CSS keyframe animation (a self-running or looping sequence), and WAAPI (JS control: dynamic values, playback, sequencing, the finished promise). Name the elements and the trigger.
4. **Spec the motion.** For a transition, name the properties, duration, timing-function, and delay, and the state that fires it. For keyframes, write the stops, the shorthand and longhands, the fill-mode, the iteration-count and direction. For WAAPI, write the keyframe array, the options (fill both), and the playback control surface.
5. **Spec the performance and the reduced-motion path.** Confirm only transform and opacity animate, name the will-change and contain use (and their removal), the 60fps and off-main-thread rationale, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` path that removes or reduces the motion.
6. **Write the spec and run the anti-pattern check.** Assemble the CSS animation spec, and confirm none of the anti-patterns are present (a layout or paint property, an idle infinite loop, a missing fill-mode, `transition: all`, JS where a transition would do, no reduced-motion path).
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm the right primitive was chosen, only transform and opacity animate, the fill-mode holds the state, loops are finite or deliberate, WAAPI is used only when JS control is needed, performance holds the budget, and the reduced-motion path exists. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
CSS ANIMATION SPEC
Brief: a card lifts and brightens on hover, plus a finite pulse ring on the call-to-action, plus a data-driven toast that slides in under JS control   Trigger: hover, load, and a JS event   Framework: none, native platform   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Primitive:
- The card lift: CSS transition (a two-state hover change). The pulse ring: CSS keyframes (a self-running finite loop). The toast: WAAPI (JS-triggered, the duration computed from the message length, slide out chained on finished).

Motion:
- Card: transition transform 220ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1) and opacity 220ms ease; :hover sets transform translateY(-6px) and opacity 1. Exact properties named, not all.
- Pulse ring: @keyframes from opacity 0 scale(0.82), 35% opacity 1, to opacity 0 scale(1.18); animation pulse-ring 1200ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1) 0s 3 normal both. Finite iteration-count 3.
- Toast: el.animate([{ transform: "translateY(24px)", opacity: 0 }, { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: 1 }], { duration: 320, easing: "cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0,1)", fill: "both" }); on animation.finished, play the slide-out.

Performance and accessibility:
- Only transform and opacity animate; will-change transform on the toast only, removed after finished; the pulse ring is contain: layout paint. All three hold 60fps off the main thread.
- Reduced-motion: under prefers-reduced-motion, the card shows its hover style with no transition, the pulse ring renders static at its mid state with no loop, and the toast appears at full opacity with no slide.
```

## Guardrails

- Never animate a layout property where a transform achieves the effect. `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, and `margin` reflow every frame; animate `transform` and `opacity`, which run on the compositor off the main thread.
- Never run an idle infinite loop. Keep `animation-iteration-count` finite and computed from the need, unless an infinite loop is a deliberate, lightweight motif; an idle infinite animation drains battery and holds a layer.
- Never omit `animation-fill-mode` where the state must hold. Use `both` so the start and end states persist before and after the run.
- Never use `transition: all` when you can name the properties, and never reach for JS where a CSS transition would do the state change.
- Never use WAAPI just to avoid CSS. Reach for it only when JS control is genuinely needed (dynamic values, playback control, sequencing, the finished promise); use `fill: "both"` so the seeked or settled state persists.
- Never leave `will-change` on elements that are not about to animate; apply it narrowly and remove it on stop.
- Never ship without a reduced-motion path. A `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query (or a `matchMedia` check in JS) that removes or reduces the motion is the mandatory floor; native motion is not exempt.
- Never invent a motion the brief did not call for, and route an orchestrated timeline or scroll choreography to the right sibling rather than hand-managing delays.
- No AI-slop in the spec: no "make it pop", no filler, no emoji. Exact properties, durations, timing functions, and keyframe stops.
- If a project playbook exists (a motion system, approved durations and easings, a performance budget), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the spec build skills read for native, dependency-free motion: the lightest path for state changes, hover and focus, single-element loops and entrances, and JS-driven WAAPI motion. Hand them the CSS animation spec to implement.
- Route an orchestrated timeline with relative offsets to `crew-animation-anime` (SVG and framework-agnostic sequences) or `crew-animation-gsap` (scroll-driven and pinned, scrubbed choreography); the platform has no real timeline.
- Route state-driven React component motion (variants, layout, exit) to `crew-animation-motion`, physics and gesture to `crew-animation-spring`, and scroll-driven reveals to `crew-animation-scroll-reveal`. CSS owns the primitives; they own the heavier orchestration.
- Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel-level craft of a single interaction (the exact hover feel, the press); this skill owns the CSS and WAAPI APIs and the compositor floor.

## Verification

Before the spec is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The platform was confirmed as the right tool (describe-the-end-state, state, or single-element loop), not an orchestrated timeline, scroll scrub, React state, or physics job
[ ] The right primitive was chosen: a transition for a state change, keyframes for a self-running sequence, WAAPI only when JS control is needed
[ ] Only transform and opacity animate; no layout property and no paint property in a loop
[ ] animation-fill-mode (both) holds the state where it must persist; iteration-count is finite unless an infinite motif is deliberate
[ ] WAAPI uses fill both and is used only for dynamic values, playback control, sequencing, or the finished promise
[ ] will-change is narrow and removed on stop; contain isolates the subtree where it helps; the 60fps budget holds off the main thread
[ ] A prefers-reduced-motion path removes or reduces the motion to a static or minimal state
```
