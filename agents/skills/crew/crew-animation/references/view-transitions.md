# View Transitions spec (consulted via crew-animation)

The browser's native View Transitions API works by snapshot rather than interpolating values over time: the browser captures the old visual state, the DOM mutates to the new state, the browser captures that, and then it cross-fades or morphs between the two snapshots inside a pseudo-element tree styled with CSS, with no per-frame JavaScript and no animation library on the critical path. This spec covers the trigger that calls `startViewTransition`, the framework path (the React `flushSync` and `useTransition` wiring, a router integration, or the cross-document MPA rule), the named elements that morph, the CSS that animates the `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` pairs, the snapshot-cost budget, the progressive-enhancement fallback, and the reduced-motion path.

## When to use View Transitions

Do not use this spec for an exact-timed, choreographed sequence where marks must hit at precise times (that is `crew-animation-gsap`), for state-driven React motion, layout, or exit animation where the React idiom and per-item control matter (`crew-animation-motion` is the fit, and it can stagger list items a single view transition cannot), for physics and gesture motion that must preserve velocity (`crew-animation-spring`), or for a designer-authored vector asset (`crew-animation-lottie` or `crew-animation-rive`). View Transitions is the native-browser snapshot-and-morph path for state and route changes; name the better tool when the work is fine-grained choreography, needs per-element staggered control during a navigation, or needs cross-browser parity today. Same-document transitions: Chrome 111+, Safari 18+, Firefox 144+. Cross-document (MPA) transitions: Chrome 126+, Safari 18.2+; Firefox does not yet support cross-document. Older browsers fall back to an instant swap.

## What a spec needs

You need:

- The motion brief: what changes (a state swap, a list reorder, a route navigation), why it should morph (continuity, spatial relationship, "the same thing moved"), and on what trigger (a click, a navigation, a state update).
- The context: the framework (vanilla, React, Next App Router, a router), whether the change is same-document (an SPA swap) or cross-document (a full navigation), and which elements are the same thing on both sides (the shared elements to morph).
- The accessibility constraint: that reduced-motion must be honoured (always), and what the reduced or instant state should be.

If the brief is too vague to spec, ask once what changes, why it should morph, and on what trigger. Never invent a transition the brief did not call for, never capture a huge subtree that does not need to morph, and never ship without a fallback for browsers that lack the API.

## How the view-transition animator thinks

1. **Snapshot, not interpolation.** A view transition does not tween values frame by frame. The browser screenshots the old state, you swap the DOM, it screenshots the new state, and it animates between the two images. You think in before and after, not in keyframes.
2. **The callback must be the synchronous DOM swap.** `startViewTransition(callback)` captures the old state, runs the callback (which must update the DOM to the new state), captures the new state, then animates. In React the state update is asynchronous, so the swap is forced synchronous with `flushSync` (or driven through `startTransition` on the experimental component path); without that, the browser captures a stale or premature frame.
3. **Name the thing that is the same.** Continuity comes from `view-transition-name`. Give the element that exists on both sides the same name and the browser morphs one into the other (a thumbnail into a hero, a tab underline between tabs). A name must be unique per transition; two live elements with the same name cause the browser to skip the entire transition (the `ready` promise rejects), not just that one element's morph.
4. **Style the pseudo-elements, not the elements.** During the transition the browser builds a `::view-transition` tree of old and new snapshots. You animate those pseudo-elements with CSS, not the real DOM nodes. The default is a cross-fade; you override it per named group.
5. **Every snapshot has a cost.** Each named element is captured as an image and promoted to its own group. Many names, or one huge subtree, makes capture and compositing expensive. Keep the named set small, size and `contain` the captured elements, and never name a giant scrolling container.
6. **Progressive enhancement and reduced-motion are the floor.** Feature-detect the API and let unsupported browsers swap instantly (the change still happens, just without the morph). Gate the named animations behind `prefers-reduced-motion` so the floor is an instant, non-animated swap.

## View Transitions core

The native API, the snapshot model, and the pseudo-element tree.

```js
// Same-document (SPA) transition. The callback IS the DOM swap.
function navigate(updateDOM) {
  if (!document.startViewTransition) { updateDOM(); return; } // progressive enhancement: just swap
  document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());            // capture old, run swap, capture new, animate
}
```

`document.startViewTransition(callback)` returns a `ViewTransition` object with three promises: `updateCallbackDone` (the callback ran), `ready` (the pseudo-elements exist and the animation is about to start, the hook for a custom Web Animations API tween), and `finished` (the transition ended). The browser drives a pseudo-element tree rooted on `document.documentElement`:

```css
::view-transition                 /* the overlay root */
  ::view-transition-group(name)   /* one per named element, animates size and position */
    ::view-transition-image-pair(name)
      ::view-transition-old(name) /* the outgoing snapshot */
      ::view-transition-new(name) /* the incoming snapshot */
```

The default animation is a cross-fade of the old and new of the root (`name` is `root` by default). To change it, target the pseudo-elements:

```css
::view-transition-old(root) { animation: 180ms ease-out both fade-out; }
::view-transition-new(root) { animation: 220ms ease-out both fade-in; }
```

The capture-then-animate model is the whole mental shift: you never write the in-between frames, you describe the start image, the end image, and the CSS that moves between them.

## React integration

React has two paths. The stable, framework-agnostic path is manual: force the DOM swap synchronous so it lands inside the `startViewTransition` callback.

```jsx
import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

function update(setState, next) {
  if (!document.startViewTransition) { setState(next); return; }
  document.startViewTransition(() => {
    flushSync(() => setState(next)); // flushSync makes the React update synchronous inside the callback
  });
}
```

`flushSync` is the key: a normal `setState` is asynchronous and would not have committed to the DOM by the time the browser captures the new snapshot, so the wrap must flush it. Pair this with a `useTransition` if the new state suspends, so the pending UI is handled while the data loads, and place the swap after the data is ready so the captured new frame is the real content, not a fallback. A `Suspense` boundary that resolves can itself be the moment to transition (content arriving), but only inside a transition, not on a bare render.

The experimental path is React's own `<ViewTransition>` component plus `addTransitionType`, currently only in React canary (the Next.js App Router bundles that canary, so it can work there behind the `experimental.viewTransition` flag, but it is not in stable React and the API can change). The actual export in React canary is `unstable_ViewTransition` (used as `<unstable_ViewTransition>` or aliased on import), not a bare `ViewTransition` export. On that path React calls `startViewTransition` for you when a `startTransition` or a `Suspense` reveal changes the tree, and you never call the native API yourself. `react-router` exposes a `viewTransition` prop on its `Link` and `useViewTransitionState` to opt a navigation into a transition (both landed in React Router v6.7+); that is the stable router path when you are on react-router. Be precise in the spec about which path you are on: the manual `flushSync` wrap is stable today, the React `<ViewTransition>` component is experimental.

## Page transitions

Two shapes. Same-document transitions are the SPA case above: the framework or router swaps the view inside `startViewTransition`, no full page load. Cross-document transitions are full navigations between two real documents (a classic multi-page app), enabled with a CSS at-rule and no JavaScript required:

```css
@view-transition { navigation: auto; } /* must be on BOTH the old and the new document */
```

With that rule the browser runs a transition across the navigation automatically, and you style it with the same pseudo-element tree. Cross-document (the `@view-transition { navigation: auto }` rule) is Chrome 126+ and Safari 18.2+ only; Firefox does not support it yet, so the MPA path degrades to an instant navigation in current Firefox. The `@view-transition` at-rule needs no JS feature-detection because unsupported engines simply ignore the at-rule and navigate normally (the fallback is automatic). That is distinct from the JS `if (document.startViewTransition)` feature-detect used for the same-document path. Shared elements morph across documents when both pages give them the same `view-transition-name`. For finer control of a cross-document navigation, the same-document Navigation API (`navigation.addEventListener("navigate", ...)` with `intercept`) lets an SPA router run its swap inside `startViewTransition`, which is how most SPA frameworks wire it. Cross-document support is newer than same-document, so feature-detect and keep the instant-navigation fallback. The `pageswap` and `pagereveal` events let you tag the outgoing and incoming documents (for example to set a directional type based on where the user is going). View-transition types (the `:active-view-transition-type` selector and the JS types API) are not supported in Firefox 144, so a type-gated directional slide must degrade to the default cross-fade there.

## Element morphing

A shared element morph is the signature move: the same logical element on both sides carries the same `view-transition-name`, and the browser tweens its size, position, and content between the two states.

```css
.card-hero { view-transition-name: hero-image; } /* on the list thumbnail and on the detail hero */
```

```css
/* style the named group's morph; it gets its own group, image-pair, old, and new pseudo-elements */
::view-transition-group(hero-image) { animation-duration: 300ms; animation-timing-function: ease; }
```

Rules that keep a morph honest:

- The name must be unique among elements live at the moment of the transition. For a list, template it: `view-transition-name: card-${id}`. Two mounted elements sharing a name make the browser skip the entire transition (the `ready` promise rejects), not just that one element's capture.
- Only the element present on both sides morphs. If the target view has no element with that name, the element fades with the root instead, so decide whether it needs a fallback animation on the paths where no pair forms.
- The named pseudo-elements (`::view-transition-old(name)` and `::view-transition-new(name)`) let you cross-fade the content while the group animates size and position, which is what makes a thumbnail expand smoothly into a hero rather than snap.
- Reserve directional slides for hierarchical or ordered navigation (list to detail, next or previous), where direction communicates depth or position. Lateral, unordered changes (tab to tab) should cross-fade, not slide, so the motion does not imply a spatial relationship that is not there.

## Performance

- **Each named element is a captured image.** The browser snapshots every element with a `view-transition-name` into its own group and composites the tree. The cost scales with the number of names and the pixel area of each capture, so keep the named set to the few elements that genuinely morph.
- **Do not name a huge subtree.** Naming a full-page scrolling container or a long list forces a large, expensive snapshot. Name the specific element that moves, not its giant ancestor.
- **Size and contain the captured elements.** Give a morphing element an explicit size where you can, and apply `contain: layout` (or `paint`) so the browser does not have to capture beyond its box. A named element with `width: auto` and unbounded content is the slow path.
- **Animate the compositor-friendly properties.** The pseudo-elements animate `transform` and `opacity` cleanly; the group animates size and position via the browser. Avoid driving expensive layout properties in your override CSS, and keep the transition short (200ms to 350ms is plenty for a UI morph).
- **Mind layout shift mid-transition.** If the new DOM reflows after the snapshot (a late-loading image, a font swap), the morph captures the wrong end frame. Reserve space, load the content before the swap (a `useTransition` or an awaited fetch), so the captured new state is stable.
- **Skip the work when nothing should morph.** For a silent background update (a revalidation, a poll), do not start a transition at all, or set the relevant names to `none`, so you are not paying snapshot cost for a change the user should not see move.

## Anti-patterns

```
A heavy or full-page named subtree                  -> name only the element that morphs; a giant snapshot is slow and janky.
Layout shift after the DOM swap                      -> load content and reserve space before the swap (await, useTransition) so the new snapshot is stable.
setState without flushSync inside the callback       -> wrap the React update in flushSync; an async setState captures a stale or premature frame.
No progressive-enhancement fallback                  -> feature-detect document.startViewTransition; let unsupported browsers swap instantly.
Two live elements sharing one view-transition-name   -> names must be unique per transition; template per item (card-${id}) so the morph forms.
A directional slide on lateral (tab-to-tab) change   -> slides imply depth; cross-fade unordered changes, reserve slides for hierarchy or sequence.
Animating layout-thrashing properties in the override-> animate transform and opacity on the pseudo-elements; let the browser own the group size and position.
A transition on every silent background update       -> set names to none or skip startViewTransition for revalidations the user should not see move.
No reduced-motion path                               -> under prefers-reduced-motion, disable the named animations so the swap is instant.
```

## Application rules

The checklist a build embeds when it uses View Transitions.

```
[ ] View Transitions is justified: a native snapshot-and-morph for a state or route change, not exact-timed choreography or per-item staggered control.
[ ] The DOM swap is the synchronous body of startViewTransition (flushSync in React); the browser captures the real new state.
[ ] Only the elements that genuinely morph carry a view-transition-name; names are unique per transition (templated for lists).
[ ] The pseudo-element tree is styled in CSS (old, new, group); the override animates transform and opacity, and the transition is short.
[ ] Snapshot cost is bounded: small named set, sized and contained captures, no giant subtree named.
[ ] A progressive-enhancement fallback exists: feature-detect the API, unsupported browsers swap instantly.
[ ] Silent background updates do not trigger a visible transition (names none or no startViewTransition).
[ ] A reduced-motion path disables the named animations under prefers-reduced-motion so the swap is instant.
```

## Speccing workflow

1. **Read the motion brief.** Name what changes, why it should morph, and on what trigger. If marks must hit exact times or per-item stagger during a navigation is needed, route to `crew-animation-gsap` or `crew-animation-motion`; if velocity-preserving gesture physics is the core, route to `crew-animation-spring`; if it is a designer asset, route to `crew-animation-lottie` or `crew-animation-rive`. Only proceed when a native snapshot morph for a state or route change is the fit.
2. **Choose the shape.** Decide same-document (an SPA swap via `startViewTransition`, or the React path) or cross-document (the `@view-transition { navigation: auto }` rule, optionally the Navigation API), and the framework path (vanilla, the manual `flushSync` wrap, the experimental React `<ViewTransition>`, or `react-router` `viewTransition`). Be explicit about what is stable versus experimental.
3. **Identify the shared elements.** Name the elements that are the same thing on both sides and assign a unique `view-transition-name` (templated for lists). Decide the fallback for navigation paths where no pair forms.
4. **Spec the trigger and the CSS.** Define the trigger that runs the synchronous DOM swap inside `startViewTransition` (with `flushSync` in React), and the CSS that animates the `::view-transition-old`, `::view-transition-new`, and `::view-transition-group` pseudo-elements (a cross-fade by default, a directional slide only for hierarchy or sequence).
5. **Spec the performance budget, the fallback, and the reduced-motion path.** Name the bounded named set, the sizing and `contain` on captures, the no-layout-shift rule, the feature-detection fallback for unsupported browsers, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query that disables the named animations.
6. **Write the spec and run the anti-pattern check.** Assemble the View Transitions spec, and confirm none of the anti-patterns are present (a heavy named subtree, a missing `flushSync`, no fallback, duplicate names, a slide on a lateral change, no reduced-motion).
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm View Transitions is justified, the swap is synchronous, the named set is bounded and unique, the pseudo-elements are styled, the fallback exists, and the reduced-motion path exists. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
VIEW TRANSITIONS SPEC
Brief: a photo grid where tapping a thumbnail morphs it into the detail hero, and the route change slides forward   Trigger: click navigating list to detail   Framework: React + flushSync   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Shape and trigger:
- Same-document SPA swap. document.startViewTransition wraps the route swap; the React state update runs inside flushSync so the new view is committed before the new snapshot is captured. A useTransition holds the pending UI while the detail data loads, so the captured new frame is the real hero, not a fallback.
- Stable path (manual flushSync wrap). The experimental React component (exported as unstable_ViewTransition in canary) is noted but not used here.

Shared elements (morphs):
- The image is the same thing on both sides: view-transition-name: photo-${id} on the grid thumbnail and on the detail hero, unique per item. On a path where the detail has no matching image, the thumbnail fades with the root instead.

Transition CSS:
- ::view-transition-group(photo-${id}) animates the size and position morph over 300ms ease. The page root uses a directional slide (old slides left, new slides in from the right) because list to detail is hierarchical; transform and opacity only. The slide is gated on a view-transition type, which is unsupported in Firefox 144, so there it degrades to the default cross-fade.

Performance:
- Only the photo and the page root are named; the grid container is not. The hero has an explicit aspect-ratio and contain: layout so the capture is bounded. The detail image is awaited before the swap so there is no layout shift mid-transition.

Accessibility and fallback:
- Progressive enhancement: if document.startViewTransition is undefined, setState runs directly and the view swaps instantly.
- Reduced-motion: under prefers-reduced-motion, the slide and morph animations are set to none so the view swaps instantly with no motion.
```

## Guardrails

- Never capture a heavy or full-page named subtree. Name only the elements that genuinely morph; a giant snapshot is the slow, janky path.
- Never let the DOM reflow after the swap. Await content and reserve space (a `useTransition`, a sized container) so the captured new state is stable, not a mid-layout-shift frame.
- Never omit `flushSync` on the React path. A normal `setState` is asynchronous and would capture a stale or premature frame inside `startViewTransition`.
- Never ship without a progressive-enhancement fallback. Feature-detect `document.startViewTransition` so unsupported browsers swap instantly. Same-document transitions: Chrome 111+, Safari 18+, Firefox 144+. Cross-document (MPA) transitions: Chrome 126+, Safari 18.2+; Firefox does not yet support cross-document.
- Never reuse one `view-transition-name` across two live elements. Names must be unique per transition; template them for lists.
- Never slide a lateral, unordered change. A directional slide implies spatial depth; reserve it for hierarchy and ordered sequences, cross-fade the rest.
- Never ship without a reduced-motion path. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, the named animations must be disabled so the swap is instant; this floor is mandatory.
- Never invent a transition the brief did not call for, and never run a transition on a silent background update the user should not see move.
- No AI-slop in the spec: no "make it pop", no filler, no emoji. Exact names, pseudo-elements, and CSS.
- If a project playbook exists (a transition system, approved durations, a browser-support floor), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the spec build skills read when their transition section calls for native View Transitions: any React or vanilla UI build, and `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder` when a state or route change should morph. Hand them the View Transitions spec to implement.
- Pair with `crew-animation-motion` on the React boundary: a single view transition cannot stagger list items during a navigation, so when per-item state-driven control matters, Motion leads; when a native snapshot morph for the whole change is enough, this spec leads. Pick by whether the work needs per-element control.
- Route an exact-timed, choreographed or scroll-scrubbed sequence to `crew-animation-gsap`, and velocity-preserving gesture physics to `crew-animation-spring`; a view transition is a snapshot morph, not a timeline or a spring.
- Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel-level craft of the morph (the exact duration, easing, and direction); this spec owns the View Transitions API and the snapshot model.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] View Transitions was confirmed as the right tool (a native snapshot morph for a state or route change), not exact-timed (GSAP), per-item staggered (Motion), or gesture physics (Spring)
[ ] The DOM swap is the synchronous body of startViewTransition; the React path wraps it in flushSync
[ ] Only the genuinely morphing elements carry a view-transition-name; names are unique per transition (templated for lists)
[ ] The pseudo-element tree is styled in CSS; the override animates transform and opacity and the transition is short
[ ] Snapshot cost is bounded: small named set, sized and contained captures, no giant subtree, no layout shift after the swap
[ ] A progressive-enhancement fallback exists; unsupported browsers swap instantly
[ ] A reduced-motion path disables the named animations under prefers-reduced-motion
```
