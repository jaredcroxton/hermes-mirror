# Anime.js spec (consulted via crew-animation)

Anime.js is a lightweight, tree-shakeable, framework-agnostic animation library (far smaller than GSAP plus ScrollTrigger) that animates DOM elements, CSS, SVG attributes, and plain JavaScript objects; this spec covers the targets, the properties, the easing and timing, the timeline with relative offsets, the SVG path drawing or morphing, the stagger, the integration cleanup, and the reduced-motion path.

## When to use Anime.js

Do not use this spec for scroll-linked or pinned-scrub motion (that is `crew-animation-gsap`, which has the scroll engine), for React-state, gesture, or layout animation (Motion is more idiomatic there), for a CSS-only micro-interaction or an infinite loop that CSS does more cheaply, or for a smooth-scroll surface (that is `crew-animation-locomotive`). Anime.js is the right tool for SVG drawing and morphing and for framework-agnostic choreographed sequences; name the better tool when the work fits it.

## What a spec needs

You need:

- The motion brief: what should animate, why it moves (a reveal, a sequence, an SVG draw or morph), and on what trigger (load, interaction, in-view).
- The context: that the work is SVG-heavy or framework-agnostic (Anime.js fits there), the elements involved, and whether it is a timeline, a stagger, or an SVG animation.
- The accessibility constraint: that reduced-motion must be honoured (always), and what the static or reduced state should be.

If the brief is too vague to spec, ask once what should animate, why, and on what trigger. Never invent a motion the brief did not call for, never animate a layout property where a transform achieves the effect, and never drive scroll motion with a raw scroll listener.

## How the Anime animator thinks

1. **Lightweight and framework-agnostic.** Anime.js is small and works with vanilla JS, React, or Vue. Reach for it for choreographed JS animation without GSAP's weight or a React-only library.
2. **SVG is its home turf.** Path drawing through `setDashoffset`, morphing the `d` attribute, line-dash, motion along a path. For SVG-heavy work, Anime.js is often the cleaner choice.
3. **Transform and opacity, always.** Use the individual transform properties (`translateX`, `rotate`, `scale`), never a transform string; `left`, `width`, `top` trigger layout. Same floor as every animation skill.
4. **The timeline is the choreography.** Sequenced motion lives in `anime.timeline` with relative offsets (`+=`, `-=`), not scattered delays. Stagger handles many elements in one call.
5. **It animates, it does not scroll.** Anime.js has no scroll engine, and a raw scroll listener thrashes the main thread. For scroll-linked motion, drive `seek` from an IntersectionObserver, or hand the scroll choreography to `crew-animation-gsap`.
6. **Know when CSS wins.** An infinite spinner or a thousand-element set belongs in CSS, not a JS animation loop (battery, main thread). Anime.js is for choreographed, finite, JS-driven sequences.

## Anime core

**Version, pin it deliberately.** This skill targets Anime.js v3, the stable, widely deployed API, installed with `npm install animejs@3` or the v3 CDN build. Anime.js v4 ships an incompatible named-export API: `import { animate, createTimeline, stagger, svg, createMotionPath } from "animejs"`, with `animate(targets, {...})` for `anime({...})`, `createTimeline()` for `anime.timeline()`, `stagger()` for `anime.stagger()`, `svg.createDrawable()` for `anime.setDashoffset`, `svg.morphTo()` for the `d` morph, `createMotionPath()` for `anime.path()`, and `ease:` for `easing:`. A bare `npm install animejs` now pulls v4, so the v3 examples below will not run on it. State the version in the spec; if the project is on v4, map the constructs below to those names.

The function, the targets, the properties, and the easing (shown in the v3 API).

```javascript
import anime from "animejs"; // v3; v4 uses named imports (see Version above)

anime({
  targets: ".element",     // a CSS selector, a NodeList, an array of elements, or a JS object
  translateX: 250,         // individual transform property (not a transform string)
  rotate: "1turn",
  scale: 2,
  opacity: [0, 1],         // an array is [from, to]
  duration: 800,           // ms
  delay: anime.stagger(100), // a number, anime.stagger(), or a function (el, i) => i * 100
  easing: "easeInOutQuad",
});
```

**Targets** can be a selector, `document.querySelectorAll(...)`, an array `[el1, el2]`, or a plain object (`anime({ targets: obj, value: 100, round: 1, update: () => {} })`) for tweening a number. **Properties** cover CSS values, the individual transforms, SVG attributes (`d`, `fill`, `strokeDashoffset`), and object values. **Easing** includes the named eases (`easeInOutQuad` and family), `spring(mass, stiffness, damping, velocity)`, `steps(n)`, and `cubicBezier(...)`. Control playback with `autoplay: false` and the instance (`anim.play()`, `anim.pause()`, `anim.restart()`, `anim.reverse()`, `anim.seek(ms)`).

## Timelines

Sequence animations with relative positioning.

```javascript
const tl = anime.timeline({ easing: "easeOutExpo", duration: 750 }); // defaults apply to every add

tl.add({ targets: ".title", translateY: [-50, 0], opacity: [0, 1] })
  .add({ targets: ".subtitle", translateY: [-30, 0], opacity: [0, 1] }, "-=500") // overlap, start 500ms before previous ends
  .add({ targets: ".button", scale: [0, 1], opacity: [0, 1] }, "+=200");          // gap, start 200ms after previous ends
```

The second argument to `add` is the offset: `"+=200"` starts after the previous ends, `"-=500"` overlaps before it ends, and a bare number is an absolute time on the timeline. The common mistake is a bare `"500"`, which is treated as absolute, not relative; use the `+=` or `-=` operator for relative timing. A timeline takes `direction` (`normal`, `reverse`, `alternate`) and `loop` (a count, kept finite).

## SVG animation

The differentiator. Anime.js animates SVG attributes directly.

```javascript
// Line drawing (the stroke draws itself on)
anime({ targets: "path", strokeDashoffset: [anime.setDashoffset, 0], easing: "easeInOutQuad", duration: 2000, delay: (el, i) => i * 250 });

// Morphing one shape into another (the d attribute, same number of points)
anime({ targets: "#shape", d: [{ value: "M10 80 Q 77.5 10, 145 80" }, { value: "M10 80 Q 77.5 150, 145 80" }], duration: 2000, direction: "alternate" });

// Motion along a path
const path = anime.path("#motion-path");
anime({ targets: ".dot", translateX: path("x"), translateY: path("y"), rotate: path("angle"), easing: "linear", duration: 2000 });
```

Rules: line drawing needs a `stroke-dasharray` on the path (set by `anime.setDashoffset`). Morphing requires both `d` values to have the same number and type of points, or the morph breaks. Animate `fill` and `stroke` for colour. For a logo or an icon, the draw-then-morph sequence reads as crafted; keep it finite and provide the final drawn state for reduced-motion.

## Keyframes and stagger

```javascript
// Keyframes: a sequence of property states for one target
anime({ targets: ".element", keyframes: [{ translateX: 100 }, { translateY: 100 }, { translateX: 0 }, { translateY: 0 }], duration: 4000, easing: "easeInOutQuad" });

// Stagger: one call animates many elements with an increasing delay
anime({ targets: ".item", translateY: [100, 0], opacity: [0, 1], delay: anime.stagger(100), duration: 600, easing: "easeOutQuad" });

// Grid stagger from center
anime({ targets: ".grid-item", scale: [0, 1], delay: anime.stagger(50, { grid: [14, 5], from: "center", axis: "x" }), easing: "easeOutQuad" });
```

`anime.stagger(value, options)` spreads a delay (or any value) across the targets. Options: `grid: [columns, rows]` for a grid layout, `from` (`"first"`, `"last"`, `"center"`, an index, or `[x, y]`), and `axis` (`"x"`, `"y"`). Keep stagger steps short (about 30 to 100ms); long steps make the reveal feel slow. One staggered call is cheaper and cleaner than a loop of separate animations.

## Integration

Anime.js is framework-agnostic; the wiring is the same idea everywhere, plus cleanup.

```javascript
// Vanilla: import and call after the DOM exists.
import anime from "animejs";

// React: create in useEffect, pause on cleanup.
useEffect(() => {
  const anim = anime({ targets: ref.current, translateX: 250, duration: 800, easing: "easeInOutQuad" });
  return () => anim.pause();
}, []);

// Vue: in mounted, anime({ targets: this.$el, ... }).
```

The scroll boundary: Anime.js has no scroll engine. To animate on entering the viewport, create with `autoplay: false` and call `anim.play()` from an `IntersectionObserver`, which gives a clean binary in-view signal and is efficient. An IntersectionObserver decides play or pause, not a continuous progress; for true scrub, sample the scroll position inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop to compute the progress and call `anim.seek(duration * progress)`, never a raw `scroll` event listener that thrashes the main thread. For any pinned or precise scrubbed scroll timeline, that is GSAP ScrollTrigger's job; route to `crew-animation-gsap`. Reduced-motion: gate the animation behind `prefers-reduced-motion` and apply the final state instantly when it is set.

## Performance rules

- **Transform and opacity, individual props.** `translateX`, `rotate`, `scale`, `opacity` are hardware-accelerated. Good: `translateX: 250`. Avoid: `left: "250px"`, `width: "500px"`, which trigger layout.
- **Batch similar animations.** One `anime({ targets: ".items", ... })` for many elements, not a `forEach` of separate `anime()` calls.
- **Units where CSS needs them.** A CSS length needs a unit (`width: "200px"`), or the value is ignored; transforms like `translateX` default to px.
- **will-change on complex animations only.** On the elements that actually animate, removed when they stop.
- **autoplay false for controlled motion.** Create paused and play from the trigger (an IntersectionObserver, an interaction).
- **Keep loops finite.** A finite iteration count, computed from the need; an infinite JS loop drains battery and holds the main thread.

## Anti-patterns

```
A CSS length with no unit (width: 200)            -> include the unit (width: "200px"); transforms default to px.
A transform string (transform: "translateX(...)") -> use individual props (translateX: 250); a string cannot be tweened.
Animating left, top, width, height                -> animate the transform and opacity; they skip layout.
A bare offset in a timeline (.add({}, "500"))     -> use a relative operator ("+=200" or "-=500") for relative timing.
No cleanup (the animation runs after unmount)      -> pause or remove the animation on teardown.
An infinite JS loop for a spinner                  -> use a CSS keyframe animation for an infinite loop; it is cheaper.
Animating a thousand elements                      -> use CSS or virtualize; a large JS animation set stutters.
A raw scroll-event listener driving seek           -> IntersectionObserver to play, rAF-sampled scroll for a true scrub, or route pinned scrub to crew-animation-gsap.
An implicit Anime.js version (a fresh install pulls v4) -> pin the version (v3 animejs@3, or the v4 named-export API); the two are incompatible.
No reduced-motion path                             -> gate behind prefers-reduced-motion and apply the final state instantly.
Reaching for Anime.js for a pinned scroll scrub or React state -> route to crew-animation-gsap or crew-animation-motion.
```

## Application rules

The checklist a build embeds when its animation section says to use Anime.js.

```
[ ] Anime.js is justified: SVG drawing or morphing, or a framework-agnostic choreographed sequence, not a scroll scrub or React state.
[ ] Only the individual transform props and opacity animate; no transform string, no layout properties.
[ ] Sequenced motion uses anime.timeline with relative offsets (+= and -=), not scattered delays.
[ ] SVG line drawing sets stroke-dasharray; morphs keep the same point count on both d values.
[ ] Stagger handles multiple elements in one call, with short steps (about 30 to 100ms).
[ ] Loops are finite; infinite loops and large element sets go to CSS instead.
[ ] Scroll work uses an IntersectionObserver to play, never a raw scroll listener; scrubbed scroll routes to crew-animation-gsap.
[ ] A reduced-motion path applies the final state instantly; the animation is cleaned up on teardown.
```

## Speccing workflow

1. **Read the motion brief.** Name what should animate, why it moves, and on what trigger. Note whether it is SVG (draw, morph, path), a sequence, or a stagger.
2. **Confirm Anime.js fits.** If the work is a pinned, scrubbed scroll timeline, route to `crew-animation-gsap`. If it is React state, gesture, or layout, route to `crew-animation-motion`. If it is an infinite loop or a large set, route to CSS. Only proceed when Anime.js is the right tool.
3. **Spec the core motion.** Name the targets, the properties (individual transforms and opacity, or SVG attributes), the easing, the duration, and the delay or stagger.
4. **Spec the timeline, the SVG, and the keyframes.** Lay out the timeline with relative offsets, the SVG line drawing (setDashoffset) or morph (matched d points) or path following, and any keyframe or grid-stagger detail.
5. **Spec the integration, the scroll boundary, the cleanup, and the reduced-motion path.** Name the wiring (vanilla, or useEffect with a pause-on-cleanup), the IntersectionObserver play for in-view motion (never a raw scroll listener), the teardown, and the reduced-motion final state.
6. **Write the spec and run the anti-pattern check.** Assemble the Anime animation spec, and confirm none of the anti-patterns are present (missing units, transform string, layout properties, a bare timeline offset, an infinite loop, a raw scroll listener, no reduced-motion path).
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm only transform and opacity animate, the timeline uses relative offsets, the SVG morph points match, loops are finite, scroll work uses an IntersectionObserver, cleanup is specified, and the reduced-motion path exists. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
ANIME ANIMATION SPEC
Brief: an SVG logo intro, the strokes draw on, one shape morphs, then the wordmark letters stagger in from center, as a timeline   Trigger: load   Context: SVG, vanilla   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Setup:
Anime.js v3 (animejs@3); import anime from "animejs"; run on DOMContentLoaded; the logo paths have a stroke-dasharray set by anime.setDashoffset.

Motion:
- Timeline (anime.timeline, easing easeOutExpo): the line draw, then the morph, then the letter stagger, sequenced with relative offsets.
- Line draw: targets the logo paths, strokeDashoffset [anime.setDashoffset, 0], duration 1400, delay (el, i) => i * 120.
- Morph: targets #mark, d keyframes between two paths with matched point counts, duration 700, at "-=300".
- Letters: targets .wordmark span, translateY [16, 0] and opacity [0, 1], delay anime.stagger(40, { from: "center" }), at "-=200".

SVG (if any):
- Line drawing via setDashoffset on the stroked paths; the morph keeps the same number of points on both d values.

Integration and accessibility:
- Trigger: plays on load (the logo is above the fold); for a below-fold logo, autoplay false and play from an IntersectionObserver.
- Cleanup: the timeline is paused on teardown.
- Reduced-motion: under prefers-reduced-motion the logo renders in its final drawn, morphed, settled state with no animation.
```

## Guardrails

- Never animate a transform string or a layout property. Use the individual transform properties and opacity; `left`, `top`, `width`, `height` trigger layout.
- Never drive scroll motion with a raw scroll-event listener. Use an IntersectionObserver to play, and route a pinned, scrubbed scroll timeline to `crew-animation-gsap`.
- Never ship without a reduced-motion path. Under prefers-reduced-motion, apply the final state instantly.
- Never leave an animation running after teardown, or use an infinite JS loop where CSS would do. Cleanup and finite loops are part of the spec.
- Never reach for Anime.js for a React-state or gesture animation, or for a smooth-scroll surface; name the better tool.
- Never leave the Anime.js version implicit. This skill targets v3 (`animejs@3`); v4 ships an incompatible named-export API, and a fresh `npm install animejs` now pulls v4. Pin the version so the spec does not ship broken on install.
- Never invent a motion the brief did not call for.
- No AI-slop in the spec: no "make it pop", no filler, no emoji. Exact targets, properties, easings, and offsets.
- If a project playbook exists (a motion system, approved easings and durations, a performance budget), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the spec build skills read for SVG drawing and morphing and for lightweight vanilla-JS sequences. Hand them the Anime animation spec to implement.
- Pair with `crew-animation-gsap`: Anime.js for SVG-heavy work and framework-agnostic sequences, GSAP for scroll-driven and pinned, scrubbed choreography. When a build needs both an SVG draw and a scroll timeline, spec the SVG here and the scroll there.
- Pair with `crew-animation-motion` for React: Motion owns state-driven React animation, gesture, and layout; Anime.js is the framework-agnostic choice when the work is SVG or outside React's idiom.
- Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel-level craft of a single interaction; this skill owns the Anime.js API and the SVG and sequence choreography.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The motion brief was clear (what animates, why, on what trigger); a scroll-scrub or React-state job was routed to the right tool
[ ] Anime.js was confirmed as the right tool (SVG or framework-agnostic sequence), not a scroll scrub, React state, or an infinite loop
[ ] The Anime.js version is pinned (v3 animejs@3) and the spec matches that API; the v4 named-export equivalents are noted if the project is on v4
[ ] Only the individual transform props and opacity animate; no transform string, no layout properties
[ ] Sequenced motion uses anime.timeline with relative offsets, not scattered delays
[ ] SVG line drawing sets stroke-dasharray; any morph keeps the same point count on both d values
[ ] Stagger handles multiple elements in one call with short steps; loops are finite
[ ] Scroll work uses an IntersectionObserver to play, never a raw scroll listener
[ ] A reduced-motion path applies the final state instantly; the animation is cleaned up on teardown
```
