# GSAP spec (consulted via crew-animation)

GSAP is the industry-standard JavaScript animation library, and ScrollTrigger is its plugin for scroll-driven motion; this spec covers the targets, the timeline structure, the eases and durations, the scroll triggers, the cleanup, and the reduced-motion and mobile handling a builder implements, animating transform and opacity only and tying scroll motion to the scrollbar through ScrollTrigger.

## When to use GSAP

Do not use this spec for a simple CSS-only micro-interaction that needs no library (a hover, a press, that is `crew-design-engineering`), for a different animation library, for non-web motion, or to choose the aesthetic (the style skills). This spec covers GSAP and ScrollTrigger motion specifically; if the motion does not need GSAP, say so.

## What a spec needs

You need:

- The motion brief: what should move, why it moves (feedback, narrative, reveal, ambience), and on what trigger (load, scroll, interaction).
- The context: the elements involved, whether it is scroll-linked, the framework (vanilla, React, a Three.js scene), and the duration or scroll distance available.
- The accessibility and device constraints: whether reduced-motion must be honoured (always) and what should happen on mobile.

If the brief is too vague to spec (no idea what moves or why), ask once what should move, why, and on what trigger. Never invent a motion the brief does not call for, never spec a scroll effect with no scroll distance, and never animate a layout property where a transform achieves the same effect.

## How the GSAP animator thinks

1. **Motion serves the narrative, not the demo.** Every animation answers "why does this move". A tween that does not aid comprehension, feedback, or the story is cut.
2. **Timelines over scattered delays.** Sequenced motion lives in a timeline with the position parameter and labels, not a pile of tweens with hand-tuned delays. A timeline is readable, seekable, and reversible.
3. **Transform and opacity, always.** Animate `x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotation`, `opacity` (compositor-only). `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` trigger layout and drop frames. This is the floor, not an optimisation.
4. **Scrub ties motion to scroll, never a scroll listener.** ScrollTrigger reads the scrollbar; a raw `scroll` event listener thrashes the main thread. For scroll-linked motion the answer is always ScrollTrigger.
5. **Register, scope, and clean up.** Plugins are registered once; triggers and tweens are killed when the element leaves or the component unmounts. An un-killed ScrollTrigger is a memory leak and a bug after a refresh.
6. **Respect the user and the device.** `matchMedia` gates motion by viewport and honours `prefers-reduced-motion`; heavy scroll effects disable on mobile. Motion that ignores reduced-motion is an accessibility failure, not a style choice.

## GSAP core

The library: tweens, timelines, easing, and the animation contract.

**Tweens** (a single animation from A to B):
```javascript
gsap.to(".box", { x: 200, rotation: 360, duration: 1, ease: "power2.inOut" }); // to a state
gsap.from(".box", { autoAlpha: 0, y: -50, duration: 0.8 });                    // from a state (entrances)
gsap.fromTo(".box", { autoAlpha: 0, scale: 0.95 }, { autoAlpha: 1, scale: 1, duration: 1 }); // explicit
gsap.set(".box", { x: 0 }); // apply immediately (duration 0)
```
Use camelCase, prefer the transform aliases (`x`/`y`/`z`, `xPercent`/`yPercent`, `scale`, `rotation`, `rotationX`/`Y`, `skewX`/`Y`, `transformOrigin`) over a raw transform string, and prefer `autoAlpha` over `opacity` (it also toggles `visibility` at 0). Never animate from `scale(0)`; start from `0.95` with opacity.

**Common vars:** `duration` (seconds), `delay`, `ease`, `stagger` (a number or `{ each: 0.1, from: "center" }`), `repeat` and `yoyo` (keep repeats finite and purposeful), `overwrite: "auto"`, the `onStart`/`onUpdate`/`onComplete` callbacks, `immediateRender: false` on a later tween targeting the same property.

**Easing:** the built-ins are `power1` through `power4`, `back`, `bounce`, `circ`, `elastic`, `expo`, `sine`, each with `.in`, `.out`, `.inOut`. Default to a strong `power` ease-out for UI; use `ease: "none"` (linear) for any scrubbed scroll animation.

**Timelines** (orchestrate tweens in sequence or overlap):
```javascript
const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { duration: 0.6, ease: "power2.out" } });
tl.from(".title", { y: 48, autoAlpha: 0 }, 0)
  .from(".accent", { scaleX: 0, transformOrigin: "left" }, "<0.2") // 0.2s after the previous starts
  .addLabel("reveal")
  .to(".cta", { scale: 1 }, "reveal");
```
The position parameter places each tween: an absolute time (`0`), relative (`"+=0.5"`, `"-=0.2"`), a label (`"reveal"`), or aligned to the previous (`"<"` same start, `">"` after it ends). Pass `defaults` into the constructor, add labels for readable sequencing, store the timeline to control it (`.play()`, `.reverse()`, `.progress(0.5)`, `.kill()`), and nest child timelines with `master.add(child, 0)`.

**Responsive and reduced-motion** with `matchMedia`, which sets up only while a query matches and auto-reverts when it stops:
```javascript
let mm = gsap.matchMedia();
mm.add({ isDesktop: "(min-width: 800px)", reduceMotion: "(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)" }, (ctx) => {
  const { isDesktop, reduceMotion } = ctx.conditions;
  gsap.to(".box", { x: isDesktop ? 500 : 0, duration: reduceMotion ? 0 : 1 });
});
```
For high-frequency updates (a mouse follower), use `gsap.quickTo("#id", "x", { duration: 0.4 })` rather than a new tween per event.

## ScrollTrigger

The scroll plugin: register it first, then tie motion to scroll position.

```javascript
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

gsap.to(".box", {
  x: 500, ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: ".box",
    start: "top center",   // [trigger position] [viewport position]
    end: "bottom center",
    scrub: 1,              // tie to the scrollbar; a number adds smoothing in seconds
    pin: false,
    markers: false,        // development only, never ship markers
    toggleActions: "play none none reverse" // onEnter onLeave onEnterBack onLeaveBack
  }
});
```

- **start and end** read `"[trigger position] [viewport position]"`: `"top top"`, `"top 80%"`, `"center center"`, with offsets (`"top top+=100"`) and shorthand ends (`"+=500"` for 500px past the start).
- **scrub** ties the animation to the scrollbar. `true` is immediate; a number (`1`, `0.5`) adds catch-up smoothing. Scrubbed tweens use `ease: "none"`.
- **toggleActions** fire at the four scroll points when not scrubbing (`"play none none reverse"` is the common reveal). `once: true` plays a reveal a single time.
- **pin** holds the trigger in place while the scroll distance passes (`pin: true`, `end: "+=500"`), with `pinSpacing` adding the spacer (default true).
- For a sequence, put **one ScrollTrigger on the parent timeline**, never one per child tween. Add `snap: { snapTo: "labels" }` to snap to timeline labels.
- After a DOM change, call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()`. For values that change on resize, use `invalidateOnRefresh: true` with a function-based value.
- Clean up: `ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill())`, or kill the individual trigger, on unmount or when the section is gone.

## Performance rules

- **Transform and opacity only.** They run on the compositor and skip layout and paint. Animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, or `padding` triggers reflow and drops frames. If a transform achieves the effect, use it.
- **60fps is the target.** Test under load (while the page is also loading or scripting). CSS and GSAP transforms stay smooth off the main thread; layout animations stutter.
- **will-change only on animating elements.** `will-change: transform` on the elements that actually move, removed when they stop. It is a memory cost, not a free win.
- **Stagger over many tweens.** One tween with `stagger` beats a loop of tweens with manual delays.
- **quickTo for high-frequency input.** A mouse follower updates a `quickTo` setter, not a fresh tween per `mousemove`.
- **Kill off-screen and on unmount.** An animation or a ScrollTrigger left running off-screen wastes frames; an un-killed trigger leaks after a refresh.
- **Let ScrollTrigger handle resize.** It debounces refresh automatically; only add custom resize logic (debounced) when a value genuinely needs recomputing.

## Common patterns

```javascript
// Reveal on scroll (once)
gsap.from(".fade-in", { autoAlpha: 0, y: 50, duration: 1,
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".fade-in", start: "top 80%", once: true } });

// Pin a section for a scroll distance
ScrollTrigger.create({ trigger: ".panel", start: "top top", end: "+=500", pin: true });

// Horizontal scroll (pin the container, scrub the track)
const panels = gsap.utils.toArray(".panel");
gsap.to(panels, { xPercent: -100 * (panels.length - 1), ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".container", pin: true, scrub: 1,
    end: () => "+=" + document.querySelector(".container").offsetWidth } });

// Parallax (two layers, different distances, ease none, scrub)
gsap.to(".bg", { yPercent: 30, ease: "none", scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".section", start: "top bottom", end: "bottom top", scrub: true } });
gsap.to(".fg", { yPercent: -20, ease: "none", scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".section", start: "top bottom", end: "bottom top", scrub: true } });

// Pin-and-tell (a scrollytelling timeline)
const tl = gsap.timeline({ scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".container", start: "top top", end: "+=800", scrub: 1, pin: true } });
tl.from(".title", { scale: 0.8, autoAlpha: 0 }).to(".box", { rotation: 360 });

// Batch reveal (many elements, staggered as they enter)
ScrollTrigger.batch(".card", { onEnter: b => gsap.to(b, { autoAlpha: 1, y: 0, stagger: 0.15 }), start: "top 85%", once: true });

// Image-sequence scrub (frame-by-frame canvas tied to scroll)
gsap.to(frame, { value: count - 1, snap: "value", ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: canvas, start: "top top", end: "+=500%", scrub: true, pin: true }, onUpdate: render });
```

For multiple elements, loop and give each its own trigger (`gsap.utils.toArray(".section").forEach(...)`), do not put one trigger on the shared selector.

## Integration

How a build wires GSAP in.

- **Script tags and CDN (vanilla):** load `gsap.min.js`, then `ScrollTrigger.min.js`, then `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)` before any trigger. Build timelines after the DOM exists.
- **React:** use the `useGSAP` hook with a `scope` ref so all GSAP created inside is reverted automatically on unmount; register the plugin once at module load. Return a cleanup that kills tweens for anything created outside the scope.
- **Three.js and WebGL:** GSAP animates any object, so tween `camera.position`, `mesh.rotation`, or `material.opacity` with a `scrollTrigger` and `scrub`, calling the render or `lookAt` in `onUpdate`.
- **Smooth-scroll libraries:** when a smooth-scroll layer is present, wire ScrollTrigger to it with `scrollerProxy` and refresh on its update, so pinning and scrubbing read the right scroll position. Prefer native scroll unless the brief genuinely needs inertia.
- **Cleanup is part of the wiring.** Every integration ends with killing triggers and tweens on teardown; a build that mounts and unmounts without cleanup accumulates dead triggers.

## Anti-patterns

```
Animating width, height, top, left, margin, or padding   -> animate transform and opacity; they skip layout.
A raw window scroll-event listener for scroll motion      -> ScrollTrigger reads the scrollbar without thrashing.
Scroll-jacking (replacing native scroll physics)         -> enhance scroll, do not seize it; never trap the user.
A blind magic-number duration with no reason             -> tie duration to the role (UI under 300ms, scrub to distance).
No mobile or reduced-motion path                         -> matchMedia gates by viewport and honors prefers-reduced-motion.
Two tweens on the same property of the same element       -> use fromTo, immediateRender: false, or one timeline.
A ScrollTrigger on each child tween of a timeline         -> put one ScrollTrigger on the parent timeline.
Forgetting gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)            -> register once before any trigger is created.
Markers left on in production                             -> markers are development only; strip before ship.
Infinite repeat with no purpose                          -> keep repeats finite and justified.
No cleanup (triggers and tweens never killed)            -> kill on unmount and on section teardown.
```

## Application rules

The checklist a build embeds when its animation section says to use GSAP.

```
[ ] The plugin is registered once (gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)) before any trigger.
[ ] Only transform and opacity animate; no width, height, top, left, margin, or padding.
[ ] Sequenced motion lives in a timeline with the position parameter and labels, not scattered delays.
[ ] Scroll-linked motion uses ScrollTrigger with scrub and ease: "none", never a scroll-event listener.
[ ] A ScrollTrigger sits on the parent timeline, not on each child tween; multiple elements each get their own trigger.
[ ] matchMedia gates heavy effects by viewport and provides a reduced-motion path; mobile disables what it should.
[ ] Triggers and tweens are killed on unmount and teardown; markers are off in production.
[ ] Native scroll is preserved; nothing scroll-jacks or traps the user.
```

## Speccing workflow

1. **Read the motion brief.** Name what should move, why it moves, and on what trigger (load, scroll, interaction). If the brief is too vague to spec, ask now. If the motion needs no library (a CSS hover or press), say so and route it.
2. **Choose the construct.** Decide a single tween, a timeline, or a scroll-linked animation. Sequenced motion is a timeline; scroll-linked motion is a ScrollTrigger on a tween or a timeline; a one-off is a tween.
3. **Spec the core motion.** Name the targets, the properties (transform and opacity only), the eases (a strong power ease-out for UI, `none` for scrub), the durations, and any stagger. For a sequence, lay out the timeline with the position parameter and labels.
4. **Spec the ScrollTrigger if scroll-linked.** Set the trigger, start, end, scrub or toggleActions, and pin. Put the trigger on the parent timeline for a sequence. Handle refresh and dynamic values with invalidateOnRefresh.
5. **Spec the integration, the accessibility, and the device handling.** Name the wiring (CDN and register, or useGSAP with a scope), the cleanup (kill on unmount and teardown), the reduced-motion path through matchMedia, and what disables on mobile.
6. **Write the spec and run the anti-pattern check.** Assemble the GSAP animation spec, and confirm none of the anti-patterns are present (layout properties, scroll-jacking, markers in production, no cleanup, no reduced-motion path).
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm only transform and opacity animate, scroll motion uses ScrollTrigger not a listener, the plugin is registered, cleanup is specified, and the reduced-motion and mobile paths exist. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
GSAP ANIMATION SPEC
Brief: a scroll-driven hero, the headline reveals, then a pinned horizontal feature scroll, then a parallax background   Trigger: scroll   Framework: vanilla   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Setup:
Load gsap.min.js then ScrollTrigger.min.js from the CDN, then gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger), after the DOM is ready.

Motion:
- .headline: gsap.from, props autoAlpha + y(48), ease power3.out, duration 0.8, scrollTrigger start "top 80%", once true.
- .panels (3): one tween, xPercent -200, ease none, scrubbed (the horizontal track).
- .bg / .fg: two parallax tweens, yPercent 30 and -20, ease none, scrub true.

ScrollTrigger (if scroll-linked):
- Horizontal: trigger .container, start "top top", end "+=" + container.offsetWidth, scrub 1, pin true.
- Parallax: trigger .section, start "top bottom", end "bottom top", scrub true, no pin.

Accessibility and device:
- Reduced-motion: matchMedia, under prefers-reduced-motion the headline appears with autoAlpha only (no translate), the horizontal scroll becomes a normal vertical stack, parallax is off.
- Mobile: under 768px the horizontal pin is disabled; panels stack vertically with simple reveals.

Cleanup:
- ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill()) on teardown; markers false in production.
```

## Guardrails

- Never animate a layout property (width, height, top, left, margin, padding) when a transform achieves the effect. Transform and opacity are the floor.
- Never drive scroll motion with a raw scroll-event listener, and never scroll-jack. ScrollTrigger reads the scrollbar; native scroll is preserved.
- Never ship without a reduced-motion path. matchMedia honouring prefers-reduced-motion is mandatory, not optional.
- Never leave triggers or tweens un-killed, or markers on, in production. Cleanup and markers-off are part of the spec.
- Never reach for GSAP when a CSS hover or press would do. Reserve the library for sequenced or scroll-linked motion; name the simpler tool when it fits.
- Never invent a motion the brief did not call for, or spec a scroll effect with no scroll distance.
- No AI-slop in the spec: no "make it pop", no filler, no emoji. Exact properties, eases, durations, and triggers.
- If a project playbook exists (a motion system, approved eases and durations, a performance budget), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the spec build skills read when their animation section says to use GSAP timelines: `crew-web-slide-deck-builder`, `crew-web-fly-through-builder`, `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder`, and any scroll build. Hand them the GSAP animation spec to implement.
- Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel and motion polish at the component level (the easing curves, the press states); this skill owns the GSAP and scroll choreography, that one owns the craft of a single interaction.
- The fly-through builder (`crew-web-fly-through-builder`) uses ScrollTrigger scrub for its frame-sequence descent; this skill specs that scroll motion.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The motion brief was clear (what moves, why, on what trigger); a CSS-only interaction was routed out
[ ] The construct fits: a tween for a one-off, a timeline for a sequence, a ScrollTrigger for scroll-linked motion
[ ] Only transform and opacity animate; no layout properties
[ ] gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger) is in the setup before any trigger
[ ] Scroll motion uses ScrollTrigger with scrub and ease "none", never a scroll-event listener
[ ] A ScrollTrigger sits on the parent timeline, not on each child tween; multiple elements each get their own
[ ] A reduced-motion path exists through matchMedia, and mobile disables what it should
[ ] Cleanup is specified (kill on unmount and teardown); markers are off in production
[ ] Native scroll is preserved; nothing scroll-jacks
```
