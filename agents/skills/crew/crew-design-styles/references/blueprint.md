# Blueprint spec (consulted via crew-design-styles)

The blueprint architect decides what pages a site needs and how they connect, before a single colour or font is chosen: the structure is derived from the site's archetype and the user's actual goals, not a generic template. This spec covers the page map, the navigation, the page templates, the information hierarchy, the user flows, and the content strategy a build skill reads first.

## When to use a blueprint

Do not use this spec to critique a single element or screen (that is `crew-design-quality` or `crew-design-composition`), to choose the visual style (that is the style skills), to lift an existing design (that is `crew-design-redesign`), or for copywriting alone. This spec plans the structure of a site, not its surface.

## What a blueprint needs

You need:

- The business and the niche: what the site is for, specific enough to pick an archetype (not "a services site" but "a roofing company in Dallas", not "skincare" but "premium men's skincare DTC").
- The primary goal: the one conversion that matters most (a phone call, a free-trial signup, a purchase, a booked call, a newsletter subscription).
- The scope: a single landing page, a homepage, or a full multi-page site, and any pages the business already knows it needs.

If the niche is too vague to pick an archetype, or the primary goal is unstated, ask once for both. A blueprint needs an archetype and a goal to derive structure from. Never invent a business, never assume a primary conversion the user did not name, and never impose a generic template in place of the archetype.

## How the blueprint architect thinks

1. **Structure before surface.** The blueprint is what build skills read first: what pages exist, what each is for, how they connect. Architecture comes before a single colour or font.
2. **The archetype shapes the structure.** A local service site, a SaaS site, a store, a marketplace each have a different optimal structure and conversion path. Name the archetype first; it drives the page map, the nav, and the section order.
3. **Order is a message, not just a list.** A trust badge in position one says something different than in position seven. Sequence carries meaning, so the blueprint specifies position, not just presence.
4. **Every page earns its place and its links.** A page exists because a flow needs it. If nothing links to it, it is an orphan; if it has no next step, it is a dead end. Pages connect or they do not belong.
5. **One primary conversion per page.** Each page has a single job (call, sign up, buy, book, subscribe). A page with three competing goals converts on none.
6. **Content is half the blueprint.** A page spec that lists sections but not the content each one needs is a wireframe, not a plan. Name what content exists and what must be created.

## Site architecture

The page map: every page the site needs, grouped by level, with its relationships drawn.

- **Levels and parent-child.** Top-level pages (the primary destinations), section parents with detail children (a Services parent over a service-detail page per service, a Blog parent over post children, a Shop parent over a product page per item). The map shows what contains what.
- **Depth discipline.** Most pages within two or three clicks of home. A page buried four levels deep is effectively invisible; if it matters, it moves up.
- **Derive from the archetype and the goals.** A local service site needs roughly Home, Services (plus a detail page per service), Service area, About, Reviews, Contact. A SaaS site needs Home, Product (plus feature pages), Pricing, Docs, Blog, Signup. A store needs Home, Shop (plus a product page), Collections, About, Reviews, Cart. The archetype sets the spine; the business goals refine it.
- **No orphans, no dead ends.** Every page has a parent and a path in, and a forward action and a way back out. A page nothing links to, or a page that leads nowhere, is a defect on the map.

## Navigation architecture

How a user moves through the structure, across four navigation layers.

- **Primary navigation.** The few top-level destinations (five to seven maximum) that carry the main paths, plus the primary conversion as a visible button. Overloading the primary nav buries the important paths.
- **Secondary navigation.** Within-section movement: a sidebar in docs, sub-tabs in a product area, breadcrumbs on deep pages so a user always knows where they are and how to climb back.
- **Footer.** The link layer done with intent: the main paths, the legal links (privacy, terms), contact, and the strategic-omission links, not a four-column dump of everything.
- **Mobile.** The primary nav collapses to a sheet or a full-screen overlay, and the primary conversion stays reachable (a sticky call or CTA bar for a local service). The hamburger is mobile only, never the primary desktop nav.
- **The you-are-here signal.** The active nav item is styled distinctly, and deep pages carry breadcrumbs, so a user is never lost in the structure.

## Page templates

The page types the site uses, each with a section spec. Reuse the archetype framework and the section taxonomy; do not invent a unique structure per page when a template fits.

The seven archetypes set the homepage and conversion shape:

```
Local service          (roofers, plumbers, dentists, gyms, lawyers)   -> call, free quote, book.
                        Signals: phone CTA in hero, license and trust badges, service-area map, before-and-after, real team photos, reviews widget.
B2B SaaS / dev tools    (workspace, infrastructure, analytics)         -> free trial, signup, book demo.
                        Signals: customer-logo strip, live demo, feature trio, pricing tiers, a usage stat.
DTC ecom                (skincare, supplements, apparel)               -> add to cart, first purchase.
                        Signals: product hero, press logos, bestseller grid, how-it-works, star ratings, subscribe-and-save, UGC gallery.
Marketplace             (two-sided platforms)                          -> two-sided signup.
                        Signals: search bar in hero, category tiles, featured listings, a host or seller CTA, trust and safety.
Media / creator         (newsletters, podcasts, publications)          -> subscribe.
                        Signals: email capture in hero, "as featured in", subscriber count, a sample issue, author bio.
Education               (courses, cohorts, bootcamps)                  -> enroll, apply, lead magnet.
                        Signals: outcome headline plus cohort dates, curriculum list, instructor credentials, outcome stats, apply CTA.
High-ticket professional(coaches, consultants, agencies)              -> book a discovery call.
                        Signals: founder-to-camera video, case studies with revenue impact, a who-this-is-for filter, a booking embed, long-form proof.
```

The section taxonomy is an open library, extend it per niche rather than bending the site to a fixed list: hero, trust-badge-row, service-area-map, social-proof-logo-bar, live-demo, feature-trio, deep-dive-feature-blocks, product-grid, how-it-works, subscribe-and-save, ugc-gallery, press-strip, testimonial-grid, case-study, pricing-tiers, comparison-table, cohort-dates-bar, instructor-bio, email-capture-hero, founder-video, booking-embed, faq, final-cta, footer.

Common page templates, each a named section list: Homepage (the archetype's section order), Detail page (a service, product, or feature deep dive), Pricing or Plans, Collection or Index, Article or Post, About, Contact or Lead, Legal, and a custom 404.

## Information hierarchy

What goes above the fold, what goes deep, and in what order.

- **The fold carries the one job.** The hero states what this page is and offers the primary conversion. A user who reads only the fold knows what this is and what to do next. State the single thing each page's fold must communicate.
- **Order by what a user must believe before they act.** Trust before the ask, proof before price, the problem before the solution. The position of a section is part of its meaning, so sequence it on purpose.
- **Depth holds the detail.** Fine print, the long FAQ, secondary proof, and specifications sit below the fold for the user who scrolls. Do not lead with the deep material.
- **One primary conversion, repeated, not scattered.** The hero CTA and a final CTA carry the same ask; a page with five competing asks converts on none.

## User flows

How a user moves from landing to converting, and what happens when they do not.

- **Entry points.** Users arrive through the front door (home) and the side doors (an ad landing page, a search result straight to a detail page, a referral link, a footer link from another page). The blueprint plans for the side doors, not just the homepage.
- **Conversion paths.** The steps from entry to the primary goal (land, see proof, see price, sign up), named per archetype and kept short. Every extra step is a place to lose someone.
- **Dead ends.** A page with no next step or no way back is a leak. Every page carries a forward action and a path home.
- **The drop-off audit.** Name where in the path a user is most likely to leave, and what the blueprint puts there to hold them (a proof point, a reassurance, a lower-commitment option).
- **Secondary flows.** The not-ready-to-convert paths (subscribe, save for later, contact, download), so a user who will not buy today is captured rather than lost.

## Content strategy

The content the blueprint requires, inventoried and assigned.

- **Inventory what exists.** Copy, images, real customer logos, case studies, team photos, reviews. Name what is already available to build with.
- **Name what must be created.** Every gap: the hero copy not yet written, the team photos not yet taken, the case study not yet documented, the real review not yet collected.
- **Real over placeholder, flagged.** Every spot that needs real content (real names, organic numbers, real photos) is marked as such, so no John Doe, no Lorem, no round-number placeholder ships into the build.
- **Content per section.** Each section in the page spec names the content it needs (a headline, one proof stat, three feature blurbs, five FAQ pairs), so the writer and the build skill know exactly what to produce.
- **Order of creation.** What content blocks the build (the hero, the core proof) versus what can follow (the deep FAQ), so the writing is sequenced to unblock the build.

## The blueprint output

The deliverable is three things, specific enough to build from without re-deciding the architecture.

- **A sitemap.** The page map with hierarchy, parent-child relationships, and the navigation placement of each page.
- **Per-page specs.** For each page: its template, its section order, its one primary conversion, and the content each section needs.
- **The key user flows.** Entry points, the primary conversion path, the secondary path, and every dead end resolved.

Where a structure is derived from real examples in the niche, report the evidence: the position of each section, how common it is (universal across most leaders, a majority, or a split), and a winners-versus-losers contrast (what the leaders do that the laggards do not), so the structure is evidence-based, not imposed. Let the count emerge from the niche; a section count is whatever the goals and the evidence support, not a fixed number.

## Application rules

The checklist a blueprint embeds. The architecture is the contract the build reads.

```
[ ] The archetype is named first; the structure derives from it and the user's goals, not a generic template.
[ ] A page map exists: every page grouped by level, parent-child relationships clear, nothing orphaned or a dead end.
[ ] Navigation is specified across four layers: primary (5 to 7, with the conversion), secondary, footer with legal, and a mobile collapse.
[ ] Each page has a template: a section list, one primary conversion, and the content each section needs.
[ ] Information hierarchy is ordered: the fold carries the one job; trust before ask, proof before price.
[ ] User flows are traced: entry points, the conversion path, no dead ends, and a secondary not-ready path.
[ ] Content is inventoried: what exists, what must be created, no placeholder content shipping.
[ ] The blueprint is specific enough to build from: a sitemap, per-page specs, and the key flows, no re-deciding needed.
```

## Blueprint workflow

1. **Clarify the brief and name the archetype.** State the business, the niche (specific enough to pick an archetype), the primary goal, and the scope. Infer the archetype and confirm it; the user can override. If the niche or goal is missing, ask now.
2. **Build the page map.** List every page the site needs, grouped by level, with parent-child relationships, derived from the archetype and the goals. Check for orphans and dead ends.
3. **Specify the navigation.** Define the primary nav (five to seven, with the conversion), the secondary nav, the footer (with legal), and the mobile collapse, plus the you-are-here signal.
4. **Spec each page template.** For each page type, give the section list (from the taxonomy, extended as the niche needs), the one primary conversion, and the content each section requires.
5. **Set the information hierarchy and trace the user flows.** For each page, name the one thing the fold must carry and order the sections by what the user must believe before acting. Trace the entry points, the conversion path, the secondary path, and resolve every dead end.
6. **Inventory the content and assemble the blueprint.** List what content exists and what must be created, flag every real-content gap, and assemble the deliverable: the sitemap, the per-page specs, and the key flows. Where evidence from the niche exists, report position and frequency.
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm every page has a parent and a path in and out, each page has exactly one primary conversion, the nav covers all four layers, the flows have no dead ends, and every content gap is named rather than filled with a placeholder. Mark a deliberate business decision kept (the playbook wins). Only then emit.

## Worked example

The blueprint as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
SITE BLUEPRINT
Business: a roofing company   Niche: roofing in Dallas   Archetype: local service   Primary goal: phone call and free-estimate form   Built: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Sitemap (page map and hierarchy):
- Home   (nav: primary)
- Services   (nav: primary)
  - Roof repair, Roof replacement, Storm damage, Inspection (one detail page each)
- Service area   (nav: primary)
- About   (nav: primary)
- Reviews   (nav: primary)
- Contact   (nav: primary + footer)
- Privacy, Terms   (nav: footer)

Navigation:
- Primary: Home, Services, Service area, About, Reviews, Contact, plus a "Call now" button.
- Secondary: breadcrumbs on each service-detail page back to Services.
- Footer: the primary paths, legal links, phone and address, service-area reminder.
- Mobile: nav collapses to a sheet; a sticky call-and-quote bar stays fixed at the bottom.

Page specs (per page):
Home (homepage)   Primary conversion: call or free-estimate form
  Fold: who we are, where we serve, and a phone number plus "free inspection".
  Sections (in order): hero (phone + free inspection), trust-badge-row (license, BBB, family-owned),
    services list, before-and-after gallery, reviews widget, service-area map, financing, faq, final-cta (repeat phone).
  Content needed: real team photos, license number, real Google reviews, before-and-after images.
Service detail   Primary conversion: free-estimate form for that service
  Fold: the service, the outcome, a quote CTA.
  Sections: hero, what-is-included, before-and-after for that service, reviews, faq, final-cta.
  Content needed: per-service copy, per-service photos.

Key user flows:
- Primary: land on Home or a service page -> see trust and proof -> call or submit the estimate form.
- Secondary: not ready -> Reviews or Service area -> save the number, return later.
- Dead ends resolved: every service-detail page links back to Services and forward to the estimate form.

Content gaps (must be created before build):
- Real team photos, the license number, a set of before-and-after images, and live Google reviews. No placeholder names or stock photos.
```

## Guardrails

- Never impose a generic template. The structure derives from the archetype and the goals; a section count and a section order are whatever the goals and the evidence support, not a fixed nine-beat.
- Never leave an orphan or a dead end. Every page has a parent, a path in, a forward action, and a way back; a page nothing links to does not belong.
- Never give a page two primary conversions. One job per page; competing asks convert on none. When a business has several goals, rank them and assign one per page.
- Never fill a content gap with a placeholder. Name the real content that must be created; no John Doe, no Lorem, no round-number stand-in ships into the build.
- Never flag a deliberate business decision as a defect. Mark it kept; the business playbook is the authority over these defaults.
- Never invent a business, a niche, or a primary goal the user did not give.
- No AI-slop in the blueprint: no "Elevate", no "Seamless", no filler, no emoji. Plain, specific page and section names.
- If a project playbook exists (a fixed sitemap, a brand structure, a required page set), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- This is the document build skills read first. Hand the sitemap and per-page specs to `crew-web-slide-deck-builder`, `crew-web-fly-through-builder`, `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder`, and any page build, so they build to the architecture rather than improvising it.
- Hand each page's section order and information hierarchy to `crew-design-composition` for the eye path, and the chosen register to a style skill (`crew-design-brutalist`, `crew-design-minimalist`, `crew-design-soft`, `crew-design-authority`) for the look.
- Route the content gaps to a writing pass, and the token system to `crew-design-language`, before the build starts.
- When the brief is to improve an existing site rather than plan a new one, hand to `crew-design-redesign` instead.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The archetype was named first, and the structure derives from it and the goals, not a generic template
[ ] A page map exists with levels and parent-child relationships; no orphan and no dead-end page
[ ] Navigation is specified across all four layers (primary with the conversion, secondary, footer with legal, mobile)
[ ] Every page has a template, exactly one primary conversion, and a section list
[ ] The information hierarchy is ordered; each page's fold carries its one job
[ ] User flows are traced: entry points, the conversion path, a secondary path, every dead end resolved
[ ] Content is inventoried; every real-content gap is named, no placeholder ships
[ ] The deliverable is build-ready: a sitemap, per-page specs, and the key flows
[ ] A deliberate business decision is marked kept; the playbook won over the defaults
```
