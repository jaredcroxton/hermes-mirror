# Patterns spec (consulted via crew-design-reference)

The pattern librarian knows what current web design looks like and what gives a build away as years old; this spec judges a design's patterns against the present convention across layout, navigation, cards, typography, colour, scroll, and responsive logic. Each pattern is read as fresh, current, tired, or timeless, and where it is dated the spec names the convention that replaced it, working from patterns actually in use on the best sites today, not personal taste.

## When to use the patterns lens

Do not use this spec to score broad visual quality (that is `crew-design-quality`), to do pixel and motion polish (that is `crew-design-engineering`), to find reference sites (that is `crew-design-reference`), or to write copy. This spec judges whether the patterns are current and names the swap.

## What a review needs

You need:

- The artefact under review: a built page, a screenshot, a code block, or a description of the patterns in use.
- Context: the page type (marketing site, SaaS app, dashboard, editorial, storefront) and the audience.
- The brand or playbook if one exists, because a deliberate retro or brand-locked pattern is not a dated mistake.

If no artefact or pattern description is supplied, ask once for the design or the page to review. Never invent a pattern the design does not use, never assume a framework it does not show, and never call a deliberate brand choice dated without saying so.

## How the pattern reviewer thinks

1. **Convention over taste.** The question is "what do the best sites do now", not "what do I like". A pattern is current because it is in live use on strong sites, not because it is new.
2. **Fresh, current, tired, timeless.** Every pattern gets one of four reads. Fresh is leading-edge (use with intent), current is the safe default, tired reads dated, timeless never goes out (hierarchy, whitespace, contrast). Calling something tired requires naming what replaced it.
3. **Name the swap, not just the flaw.** A review that says "the carousel is dated" is half a review. "Replace the testimonial carousel with a static two-column grid or a bento of quotes" is the whole one.
4. **New is not the same as good.** A trend used everywhere for a year is on its way to tired. Recommend what is current and durable, not what is merely trending.
5. **Respect the brand.** A deliberate retro, brutalist, or brand-locked pattern is a decision, not a dated mistake. Mark it kept; the playbook is the authority.

## Layout patterns

The current layout vocabulary. Asymmetry and intentional grids have replaced centred symmetry.

- **Split hero (current default).** Content on one side, an asset or product shot on the other, often 50/50 or 60/40. Reads modern and gives the eye a clear path. Has displaced the centred-text-over-image hero for most marketing pages.
- **Bento grid (fresh, now mainstream).** Asymmetric tiles of varying size grouping related content, popularised by Apple and now standard for feature and product sections. Each tile holds one idea; sizes signal priority. Replaces the row of three equal cards.
- **Z-pattern and F-pattern (timeless).** The eye moves in a Z across a simple landing section and in an F down text-heavy pages. Use them to place the headline, the proof, and the call to action where attention already lands.
- **Zig-zag (timeless).** Alternating image-left and image-right feature rows. Durable for a sequence of features because the alternation keeps a long page from feeling like a list. Keep the alternation honest; do not break the rhythm at random.
- **Immersive full-viewport hero (use with intent).** Full-height, a restrained animated gradient or a single product, a quiet scroll cue. Strong for a flagship product or a launch; overkill for a utility app. The asset must earn the viewport.
- **Editorial asymmetry (current).** Deliberate offset, overlapping elements, large negative space, a broken grid that still aligns to a system. Signals craft. Distinct from random misalignment, which signals the opposite.

## Navigation patterns

- **Sticky header that shrinks or simplifies on scroll (current default).** The header condenses after the first scroll, keeping navigation reachable without dominating. Replaces the fixed full-height nav bar.
- **Command palette (fresh, for tools).** A keyboard-summoned search-and-action overlay (the pattern Linear and Raycast made standard). Expected in a power-user product; out of place on a brochure site.
- **Mega menu, used sparingly (current).** A full-width panel for a large catalogue, revealed on intent, with a clear grid inside. Useful for commerce and docs; avoid for a small site that needs only a few links.
- **Mobile bottom sheet and full-screen menu (current).** On mobile, a bottom sheet or a full-screen overlay beats a tiny cramped dropdown. The hamburger belongs on mobile only, never as the primary desktop nav.
- **In-page anchored nav and progress (current for long pages).** A sticky table of contents or a reading-progress indicator on long-form and docs. Orients the reader without stealing space.

## Card and container patterns

- **Bento and grouped tiles over equal cards (current).** Group by meaning and size by priority. The uniform three-equal-cards row is the single most dated container pattern and the clearest AI tell.
- **Dividers and negative space over boxes (current at density).** At higher density, separate content with hairline borders (`border-t`, `divide-y`) and space rather than wrapping everything in a bordered, shadowed card. Cards earn their elevation only when it communicates hierarchy.
- **Restrained glass, not glass-on-everything (corrected).** Frosted glass was overused around 2021. It is current only as an occasional accent (a floating nav, one overlay), with a real inner border and a tinted shadow, never on every card.
  ```css
  .glass { background: rgba(255,255,255,0.08); backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(160%);
           border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.12); }
  ```
- **Tinted, soft elevation (current).** When a shadow is used, keep it soft, wide, and tinted to the background hue. Hard black drop shadows on every card read dated.
  ```css
  --elevation-1: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);
  --elevation-2: 0 8px 24px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.10);
  ```
- **Spotlight and border-gradient cards (fresh).** A card whose border or surface lights under the cursor, used once or twice as a highlight, reads current. Used on every card, it becomes noise.

## Typography conventions

- **Fluid type with clamp (current default).** Scale type to the viewport with `clamp()` rather than fixed breakpoint jumps. The current convention for a smooth, intentional hierarchy.
  ```css
  --font-size-base: clamp(1rem, 0.9rem + 0.5vw, 1.25rem);
  --font-size-3xl:  clamp(3.5rem, 2.5rem + 5vw, 6rem);
  ```
- **Variable fonts and a distinct face (current).** A variable font for fluid weight and width, and a face with character (Geist, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk, a quality serif for editorial) rather than the default. Inter on a premium page reads as the AI default.
- **Hierarchy by weight and measure, not just size (timeless).** Control the eye with weight, colour, and a comfortable measure (about 65 characters for body), not a single oversized heading. The screaming H1 is a tired tell.
- **Large editorial display type (fresh).** Oversized, tightly tracked display headings with short leading, used as the visual anchor. Strong when the rest of the page stays quiet.

## Colour conventions

- **One accent on a neutral base (timeless and current).** One saturated accent, kept under roughly 70 to 80 percent saturation, on a Zinc or Slate neutral base. Two accents and a gradient glow is the dated AI signature.
- **OKLCH for perceptual uniformity (fresh, now practical).** Define colour in OKLCH so lightness is consistent across hues and contrast is easier to hold. The current way to build a token system.
  ```css
  --color-accent: oklch(65% 0.18 250);
  --color-neutral-900: oklch(20% 0 0);
  ```
- **Dark-first or true dark mode (current).** A real dark theme with layered neutrals (not pure black) is expected in tools and developer products. Off-black (zinc-950, charcoal), never `#000000`.
- **Contrast as a hard floor (timeless).** Body text meets a strong contrast ratio; do not trade legibility for a moody low-contrast look. Muted does not mean unreadable.
- **Retired: mesh-gradient-on-everything and pastel blob palettes (tired).** The 2021 corporate-memphis gradient and pastel-blob look reads dated. One controlled gradient as a hero accent is fine; gradients on every surface are not.

## Scroll patterns

- **Scroll-triggered reveals with restraint (current).** Content fades or rises into place once on entry, with a small offset and a short stagger. The convention, as long as it fires once and does not re-animate on every pass.
- **Pinned, scrubbed sections (fresh, use with intent).** A section that pins while a sequence or a product scrubs to scroll. Strong for a flagship story; heavy for a utility page. Tie motion to scroll, never to a raw scroll listener.
- **Parallax, light touch (current but easy to overdo).** A subtle depth difference between layers reads current; aggressive multi-layer parallax everywhere reads 2018.
- **Scrollytelling for narrative (fresh, for the right content).** Content that reveals and transforms as a story unfolds, for a data story, a launch, or an explainer. Not for a pricing page.
- **Scroll-driven CSS and view transitions (fresh).** Native scroll-timeline and the View Transitions API now do work that needed heavy JS, with better performance. Prefer them where support allows.
- **Never hijack the scroll (timeless rule).** Do not replace native scroll physics, momentum, or keyboard scrolling. Enhance scroll, do not seize it. Full-page scroll-jacking is the fastest way to frustrate a user and date a site.

## Responsive patterns

- **Mobile collapses to one honest column (timeless).** Any asymmetric or multi-column layout falls to a single column under about 768px, full width, comfortable padding. A clever desktop grid that breaks on a phone is worse than a plain one that holds.
- **Fluid over fixed breakpoints (current).** Fluid type and spacing with `clamp()` reduce the number of hard breakpoints and the jumps between them.
- **Container queries (fresh, now usable).** Size a component to its container, not just the viewport, so a card behaves correctly in a sidebar and in a full-width grid. The current way to build genuinely reusable components.
- **Touch targets and spacing (timeless).** Interactive targets at least about 44 by 44 pixels with space between them. Cramped tap targets are an accessibility failure, not a style choice.
- **Real-device testing (timeless).** Test on real phones, not just a resized window, especially for any gesture or scroll interaction.

## The dated-pattern watchlist

What screams old, and the year it peaked, with the current swap. Flag any of these unless the brand playbook deliberately calls for it.

```
Centered hero, big H1 in Inter, three equal cards      (2022 AI default) -> split or bento hero, a distinct face, sized tiles.
Testimonial or logo carousel as the hero proof         (2018)            -> a static grid or a bento of quotes; no auto-rotating slider.
Heavy glassmorphism on every card                      (2021)            -> restrained glass as one accent; dividers and soft elevation elsewhere.
Mesh gradient and pastel blobs on every surface        (2021)            -> one controlled gradient accent on a neutral base.
Hard black drop shadows on every card                  (2016)            -> soft, wide, tinted elevation, used only where it signals hierarchy.
Neumorphism (soft extruded UI)                          (2020 fad, dead) -> flat surfaces with clear contrast and real borders.
Full-page scroll-jacking sections                      (2015)            -> native scroll with restrained scroll-triggered reveals.
Mouse-trail or custom content cursors on a content site (2019)           -> the native cursor; reserve custom cursors for a creative showcase.
Aggressive multi-layer parallax everywhere             (2018)            -> a single subtle depth layer, or none.
Corporate-memphis or "alegria" blob illustration       (2020)            -> real product shots, photography, or a custom illustration style.
Hamburger menu as the primary desktop nav              (2017)            -> a visible horizontal nav on desktop; the hamburger is mobile only.
Autoplaying muted video hero with no purpose           (2017)            -> a still or a short looped clip that earns the bandwidth.
Outer glows and gradient-fill text on headings         (2022 AI)         -> solid type, hierarchy by weight; glow only as a deliberate effect.
```

Timeless, never on the watchlist: clear hierarchy, generous whitespace, strong contrast, honest alignment, fast load, accessible motion, content before decoration. These do not date.

## Application rules

How a build skill uses this library. The pattern read becomes a gate, fresh and current pass, tired must be swapped.

```
[ ] Hero is split, bento, or an intentional immersive frame, not centered-text-over-image with three equal cards.
[ ] Cards group by meaning and size by priority (bento), or use dividers at density, not a uniform equal-card row.
[ ] Type is fluid (clamp) in a distinct face, hierarchy by weight, not a screaming Inter H1.
[ ] One accent on a neutral base, OKLCH tokens, real dark mode if a tool, no AI-purple gradient glow.
[ ] Scroll enhances and reveals once; native scroll is never hijacked; parallax is subtle or absent.
[ ] Glass and shadow are restrained accents, not applied to every surface.
[ ] Mobile collapses to one honest column; touch targets are at least 44px; container queries where components repeat.
[ ] Nothing on the dated-pattern watchlist ships unless the brand playbook deliberately calls for it.
```

## Review workflow

1. **Identify the page type and the patterns in use.** Name what is being reviewed and list the patterns actually present (the hero shape, the card style, the navigation, the type, the colour, the scroll behaviour). If no artefact is present, ask for it now.
2. **Sweep each pattern category.** Check the design against Layout, Navigation, Card and container, Typography, Colour, Scroll, and Responsive patterns. For each pattern present, decide fresh, current, tired, or timeless.
3. **Run the dated-pattern watchlist.** Flag every pattern that matches a watchlist entry, unless the brand playbook deliberately calls for it (mark those kept).
4. **Mark and explain.** For each flagged pattern, state why it reads dated and the year or origin it belongs to, so the read is specific, not "it looks old".
5. **Name the current swap.** For every tired pattern, give the current replacement from the library, concretely enough to act on.
6. **Write the pattern review.** Assemble the per-category reads, the flagged patterns with their swaps, and a verdict (Current, Refresh, or Dated) with the single highest-impact swap.
7. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm every flagged pattern is actually in the design, every swap is a real current convention (not a personal preference or a passing trend), and a deliberate brand choice was marked kept, not flagged (the playbook wins). Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
DESIGN PATTERN REVIEW
Artifact: SaaS marketing landing page   Page type: marketing   Reviewed: 2026-06-24   Mode: Careful

Verdict: Refresh   Highest-impact swap: replace the centered hero and the three equal cards with a split hero and a bento grid.

Pattern reads:
- Layout: Tired  a centered-text hero over a gradient, with a three-equal-card feature row.
- Navigation: Current  a sticky header that shrinks on scroll.
- Cards: Tired  every card wrapped in a hard drop shadow plus heavy glass.
- Typography: Tired  Inter at a huge centered weight, hierarchy by size alone.
- Colour: Tired  a purple-to-blue gradient glow on the primary button.
- Scroll: Current  reveal-on-entry firing once, native scroll preserved.
- Responsive: Current  collapses to a single column under 768px.

Dated patterns flagged (with the current swap):
- Centered hero plus three equal cards (peaked 2022) -> a split hero, then a bento grid sized by priority.
- Glass on every card (peaked 2021) -> restrained glass on one element; soft tinted elevation elsewhere.
- Inter screaming H1 (2022 AI default) -> a distinct variable face, hierarchy by weight, fluid clamp scale.
- AI-purple gradient glow (2022 AI) -> one desaturated accent on a neutral base, no glow.

Kept by the playbook (deliberate, not dated):
- The brand green accent (locked in the brand system).
```

## Guardrails

- Never call a pattern dated without naming the current convention that replaced it. A flag without a swap is half a review.
- Never confuse new with good. A pattern used everywhere for a year is heading for tired; recommend what is current and durable.
- Never flag a deliberate brand or retro choice as a mistake. Mark it kept; the brand playbook is the authority over these defaults.
- Never invent a pattern the design does not use, or a convention you cannot defend as actually in current use on strong sites.
- Never recommend a trend that fights performance or accessibility (scroll-jacking, content cursors, parallax overload). Current never overrides usable.
- No AI-slop in the review: no "make it modern", no filler, no emoji. Named patterns, concrete swaps.
- If a project playbook exists (a brand system, an approved pattern set, a deliberate aesthetic), it is the authority. Follow it over these defaults.

## Pairings and boundaries

- Pair with `crew-design-quality` (broad dimensional sweep) and `crew-design-engineering` (pixel and motion polish); this skill judges whether the patterns are of this era. Run all three for a full standards pass.
- Pull a north-star reference from `crew-design-reference` when a swap needs a concrete example ("replace the carousel with a bento, like the feature grids on the reference list").
- Embed the Application rules into the design-review gates of `crew-web-slide-deck-builder`, `crew-web-fly-through-builder`, and `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder`, so a build cannot ship a watchlist pattern unnoticed.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The page type and the patterns actually in use were identified from the artifact
[ ] Every pattern category was swept (layout, nav, cards, type, colour, scroll, responsive)
[ ] Each pattern is marked fresh, current, tired, or timeless
[ ] Every dated pattern was checked against the watchlist and carries a specific year or origin
[ ] Every tired pattern has a concrete current swap, not just a flag
[ ] A deliberate brand or retro choice is marked kept; the playbook won over the defaults
[ ] No invented pattern, and no swap that is mere preference or a passing trend
[ ] No recommendation that fights performance or accessibility
[ ] A Current / Refresh / Dated verdict with the single highest-impact swap
```
