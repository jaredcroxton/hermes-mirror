# Reference library spec (consulted via crew-design-reference)

The reference library is the place a builder goes to answer "what does great look like for this?": fifty real sites across SaaS, fintech, luxury, editorial, motion, and experimental, matched to the design problems they already solved. This spec names, for every reference, the principle it demonstrates, the precise reason it reads premium, and the exact thing an AI build would get wrong instead; it never invents a site or a URL, and it points at the right north star rather than redesigning or scoring.

## When to use the reference library

Do not use this spec to score an existing design (that is `crew-design-quality`), to do pixel and motion polish (that is `crew-design-engineering`), to write copy, or to fetch and reproduce a brand's exact design tokens (a separate brand-extraction job). This spec points at references and names the lesson; it does not build.

## What a lookup needs

You need:

- The design problem or output in question: what is being built (a billing page, a dashboard, a luxury storefront, a long-form article) or an output to benchmark.
- The aesthetic goal: the feeling or standard to hit (trustworthy and exact, warm and editorial, dense and fast, immersive and experimental).
- The category if known (SaaS, fintech, luxury, editorial, motion, agency). If not, the reviewer derives it from the problem.

If the problem is too vague to match (no category, no goal, no artefact), ask once what is being built. Never invent a reference site, a URL, or a design fact to fill a gap. If the library does not hold a strong match, say so plainly rather than naming a weak one.

## How the reference reviewer thinks

1. **Pattern-matching over opinion.** The answer is "the sites that already solved this", not "what I would do". A reference is evidence; taste backed by a real example beats taste asserted.
2. **Principle over style.** Name the transferable rule (one accent under 70 percent saturation, deliberate grid asymmetry, restraint as the flex), not the surface look. The principle survives a brand swap; the look does not.
3. **Specificity over praise.** "Looks clean" is useless. "One typeface, generous leading, a single gradient as the only flourish, everything else black on white" is a brief. Every entry earns its place with a concrete reason.
4. **What AI gets wrong is the real lesson.** Each reference is paired with the slop an AI would ship instead (centred hero, Inter, gradient glow, equal cards). The gap between the two is the teaching.
5. **Honesty over coverage.** Forty real references beat fifty with filler. If a site cannot be explained on both counts, it does not belong in the library.

## The reference library

Fifty real sites, grouped by what they teach. Each entry: the principle, why it reads premium (specific), what an AI build gets wrong, and when to reach for it. Several sites teach more than one lesson; cross-references are noted in Reference lookup.

### Typography-forward and minimal SaaS

- **Stripe** (stripe.com). *Typographic restraint plus one signature flourish.* Premium: a single crisp sans, generous leading, deliberate asymmetric columns, and one animated mesh gradient as the only decoration, everything else near-black on white.

## Anti-slop lens

What an AI build consistently gets wrong per category, distilled from the library so a reviewer can name the gap fast.

```
SaaS and developer: a centered hero, Inter, a purple-to-blue gradient glow, three equal feature cards, light mode by default. The references go dark, custom-faced, one-accent, and product-led.
Fintech: muddy gradients, timid type, fluoro to look modern. The references go bold, plain-spoken, and reassuringly calm.
Luxury and fashion: a hero gradient, a carousel, bright CTAs, social-proof badges, filling the whitespace. The references strip out everything and let imagery and space carry status.
Editorial: a single equal-weight column with no hierarchy, a generic chart library. The references rank ruthlessly and build custom visuals.
Motion and experimental: a parallax background passed off as immersive, a token fade-in. The references commit to a real, authored, often 3D experience.
Density and dashboards: every metric boxed in an equal card, washed-out contrast, a marketing hero hiding the product. The references show the product honestly and group with hierarchy, not boxes.
```

## Application rules

How the build skills use this library. Cite the reference by name so the standard is unambiguous.

```
Billing or payments page      -> reference Stripe for typographic restraint and Wise for confident numbers.
Task, issue, or project UI    -> reference Linear for calm dark-mode density.
Developer tool or platform    -> reference Vercel for monochrome discipline, Resend for code-first minimalism.
Dashboard or data product     -> reference Sentry and Supabase for legible density, Retool for tooling.
Luxury or premium storefront  -> reference Aesop and Bottega Veneta for whitespace-as-luxury, Rolex for cinematic product.
Long-form or editorial        -> reference Stripe Press and Medium for reading craft, The Pudding for data story.
Agency, studio, portfolio     -> reference Pentagram and Instrument for work-first grids.
Immersive launch or showcase  -> reference Igloo Inc, Lusion, and Bruno Simon for committed experience.
```

A build skill should pull the matching reference and its anti-slop lesson into its own design-review gate, so "make it premium" becomes "make it like this, and avoid that".

## Lookup workflow

1. **Identify the category and the principle needed.** Restate what is being built and the aesthetic goal in one line, and name the category and the design principle the problem turns on (density, restraint, motion, whitespace). If the problem is too vague to match, ask now.
2. **Search the library.** Find the references whose principle matches, using Reference lookup. Prefer a precise match over a famous name; a less famous site that nails the exact problem beats a famous one that does not.
3. **Return the top three to five matches with full entries.** For each, give the principle, the specific why-premium, and the what-AI-gets-wrong lesson. Never include a site you cannot explain on both counts.
4. **Apply the anti-slop lens.** For the category, name what an AI build would default to and how the references avoid it. This is the part the builder acts on.
5. **Write the reference brief.** A short, copyable summary: what to emulate (the transferable principles), what to avoid (the slop), and which one reference to treat as the primary north star.
6. **Verify before emitting.** Confirm every site named is real with a correct URL, every claim is specific and true to the site, no reference was invented, and the brief actually answers the problem asked. If the library has no strong match, say so rather than naming a weak one. Only then emit.

## Worked example

The spec as the source skill returned it, the shape a consult answer should take.

```
DESIGN REFERENCE BRIEF
Problem: a SaaS billing dashboard   Aesthetic goal: trustworthy, exact, dense but calm   Category: fintech / data   Mode: Careful

References (best match first):
1. Stripe (stripe.com) - typographic restraint plus one signature flourish
   Why premium: one crisp sans, generous leading, asymmetric columns, a single gradient as the only decoration.
   AI would get wrong: a centered hero in Inter with a purple glow on every button.
2. Sentry (sentry.io) - dense data made legible
   Why premium: a controlled accent on dark, clear hierarchy, stack traces shown without fear, density that still scans.
   AI would get wrong: boxing every metric in an equal card and washing out the contrast.
3. Wise (wise.com) - bright accent with a serious job
   Why premium: one vivid green, big confident numbers, clarity over decoration for a money product.
   AI would get wrong: muddy gradients and tiny timid type on a financial page.

Primary north star: Stripe, for the billing surface itself; borrow Sentry's density model for the data tables.

Emulate: one accent, generous leading, hierarchy by weight, numbers shown big and confidently, dividers over boxes at density.
Avoid: centered hero, Inter, gradient glow, equal-weight cards, washed-out contrast.
```

## Guardrails

- Never invent a reference site, a URL, or a design fact. Every site named is real and every claim is specific and true to that site. If you are not sure a site does what you would claim, leave it out.
- Never include an example you cannot explain on both counts: why it works AND what an AI build would get wrong. Forty real references beat fifty with filler.
- Never substitute praise for specifics. "Looks clean" is not a reference; a named principle and a concrete reason is.
- Never override a project's own brand playbook with a reference. The playbook is the authority; the reference informs, it does not dictate.
- Never reproduce a site's proprietary assets or copy; cite the principle and the URL, do not lift the content.
- No AI-slop in the brief itself: no filler adjectives, no emoji. Specific principles, real sites.
- If a project playbook exists (a brand system, approved references, an aesthetic direction), it is the authority. Follow it over this library.

## Pairings and boundaries

- Feed the chosen references and the anti-slop lesson into the design-review gates of `crew-web-slide-deck-builder`, `crew-web-fly-through-builder`, and `crew-web-lead-dashboard-builder`, so each build aims at a named north star.
- Pair with `crew-design-quality`: this skill says what to aim at, quality scores whether the build hit it. Pair with `crew-design-engineering` for the pixel and motion craft once the direction is set.

## Verification

Before the run is marked done, confirm:

```
[ ] The category and the design principle the problem turns on were named
[ ] Three to five references returned, each with a principle, a specific why-premium, and a what-AI-gets-wrong lesson
[ ] Every site is real with a correct URL; nothing was invented to fill a gap
[ ] No reference was included that could not be explained on both counts
[ ] The anti-slop lens for the category was applied
[ ] A primary north star was named, and the brief answers the problem asked
[ ] Where the library had no strong match, that was stated plainly, not papered over
[ ] The project playbook, if any, won over the library
```
