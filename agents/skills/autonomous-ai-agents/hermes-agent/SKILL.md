# Hermes Agent

Hermes Agent is an open-source AI agent framework by Nous Research that runs in your terminal, messaging platforms, and IDEs. It belongs to the same category as Claude Code (Anthropic), Codex (OpenAI), and OpenClaw — autonomous coding and task-execution agents that use tool calling to interact with your system. Hermes works with any LLM provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, local models, and 15+ others) and runs on Linux, macOS, and WSL.

What makes Hermes different:

- **Self-improving through skills** — Hermes learns from experience by saving reusable procedures as skills. When it solves a complex problem, discovers a workflow, or gets corrected, it can persist that knowledge as a skill document that loads into future sessions. Skills accumulate over time, making the agent better at your specific tasks and environment.
- **Persistent memory across sessions** — remembers who you are, your preferences, environment details, and lessons learned. Pluggable memory backends (built-in, Honcho, Mem0, and more) let you choose how memory works.
- **Multi-platform gateway** — the same agent runs on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Email, and 10+ other platforms with full tool access, not just chat.
- **Provider-agnostic** — swap models and providers mid-workflow without changing anything else. Credential pools rotate across multiple API keys automatically.
- **Profiles** — run multiple independent Hermes instances with isolated configs, sessions, skills, and memory.
- **Extensible** — plugins, MCP servers, custom tools, webhook triggers, cron scheduling, and the full Python ecosystem.

People use Hermes for software development, research, system administration, data analysis, content creation, home automation, and anything else that benefits from an AI agent with persistent context and full system access.

**This skill helps you work with Hermes Agent effectively** — setting it up, configuring features, spawning additional agent instances, troubleshooting issues, finding the right commands and settings, and understanding how the system works when you need to extend or contribute to it.

For profile-backed specialist agents, run gateway commands through that profile's alias (for example `<agent_alias> gateway start`) so the gateway reads the profile-local config and `.env`. When giving each agent a separate Telegram bot, store `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/.env`, not the default profile, and verify with Telegram `getMe` before starting the service. See `references/profile-telegram-bots.md`.

**Rolling out a new default model across all specialist profiles**
1. **Verify first. Never bulk-roll out an untested model name.** Run a one-shot probe against the intended provider/model, for example: `hermes chat -q "Reply exactly OK" --provider openai-codex -m "gpt-5.4" --quiet`.
2. Confirm auth route and provider. Jared prefers ChatGPT/Codex where possible without separate API costs; this usually means `openai-codex`, not an OpenAI API key. Check with `hermes status --all` and `hermes auth list`. For profile-wide OpenAI Codex rollouts, verify each profile can see valid Codex OAuth credentials. Profile `auth.json` files are isolated; if probes fail with `Codex auth is missing access_token`, copy the verified `openai-codex` provider and credential-pool entries from `~/.hermes/auth.json` into each affected `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/auth.json`, preserving backups and file mode `0600`.
3. Update main config: `hermes config set model.default "<verified-model>"` and `hermes config set model.provider "<verified-provider>"`.
4. Apply to every profile: `hermes --profile <name> config set model.default "<verified-model>"` and `hermes --profile <name> config set model.provider "<verified-provider>"`.
5. Profiles that commonly need this treatment: bobbuilder, harryhr, laralearning, nellynotebook, pollyperformos, samstudynerd, atticuscounsel.
6. Restart the profile gateways/handlers so cached config is dropped.
7. Verify with both `hermes profile list` and direct profile probes such as `hermes --profile bobbuilder chat -q "Reply exactly BOB_OK" --quiet`.
8. If removing a provider such as Grok/xAI, clean auxiliary config, plugins, auth pools, and profile-local auth too. See `references/profile-model-migration-and-provider-cleanup.md`.

Pitfall: Do not assume adjacent model names exist or are accessible. Always probe the exact intended model/provider before rollout. `gpt-5.5` was verified working through `openai-codex` for Jared's configured account on 28 May 2026.

**Switching a single profile's model/provider**

When only one agent needs a different model (not a full-stack migration):

1. Set the model and provider on that profile only:
   ```bash
   hermes --profile <name> config set model.default "<model>"
   hermes --profile <name> config set model.provider "<provider>"
   ```
2. If the provider requires a `base_url` (DeepSeek, custom endpoints), set it:
   ```bash
   hermes --profile <name> config set model.base_url "<url>"
   ```
3. **Critical pitfall: API keys do not inherit from the default profile.** Each profile's `.env` is isolated. If the target provider's key exists only in `~/.hermes/.env` (default), you must copy it into the profile's own `.env`:
   ```bash
   echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=REDACTED" >> ~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/.env
   ```
   Skip this step and the profile will fail with 401 authentication errors.
4. Restart the profile gateway so the cached config is dropped:
   ```bash
   hermes --profile <name> gateway restart
   ```
5. Verify with a one-shot identity probe:
   ```bash
   hermes --profile <name> chat -q "Reply exactly <AGENT>_OK" --quiet
   ```

Pitfall: DeepSeek models can silently return empty when the context window is overloaded with many tool calls in a single turn. The model does not error — it just stops. This looks like a hang but is actually a context-saturation failure. If an agent on DeepSeek stops mid-workflow with "Model returned empty after tool calls," reduce the number of tools loaded per turn or switch back to a model with more reliable large-context handling (e.g. gpt-5.4 via openai-codex). For the full per-profile migration recipe including API key handling, gateway restart, and verification, see `references/deepseek-migration.md`.

**Wiring a fresh Telegram bot token to a profile-backed agent (e.g. Atticus_legalbot)**
1. Prefer the standard profile gateway. Do **not** build a custom polling handler unless the gateway path is explicitly unavailable. A BotFather token alone only creates the bot identity; Hermes still needs a running profile gateway or handler to answer messages.
2. Add the token to the profile `.env`:
   ```bash
   echo 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8361997520:AAGp-8HmgeR2JFP76hqAcZ-QP_RMF1kEeZg' >> ~/.hermes/profiles/atticuscounsel/.env
   ```
3. Allowlist your Telegram user ID:
   ```bash
   echo 'TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=8647481186' >> ~/.hermes/profiles/atticuscounsel/.env
   ```
4. Start/restart the profile gateway:
   `hermes --profile atticuscounsel gateway start`
5. Test the bot at t.me/Atticus_legalbot immediately after the gateway reports ready.
6. If forced to use a custom Telegram polling handler, verify these before telling Jared it is live:
   - Profile name matches `hermes profile list` exactly. Jared's profiles commonly omit underscores, e.g. `atticuscounsel`, not `atticus_counsel`.
   - Non-interactive Hermes syntax is `hermes -p <profile> chat -q "message" --quiet`. Do not use stale flags such as `--once` or `--no-color`.
   - Send Telegram replies without Markdown parse mode unless the output is escaped. Markdown parse errors can make the bot appear silent.
   - Run a real end-to-end message test and inspect handler logs before claiming success.
7. Jared dislikes being walked through avoidable terminal steps. When you have tool access, do the edits, restarts, and verification yourself instead of repeatedly asking him to run commands.

Supported platforms: Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Email, SMS, Matrix, Mattermost, Home Assistant, DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, BlueBubbles (iMessage), Weixin (WeChat), API Server, Webhooks. Open WebUI connects via the API Server adapter.

For named specialist agents (for example a dedicated build/deploy worker), prefer a **profile-backed agent**: create/clone a profile, put the specialist contract in that profile's `SOUL.md`, create a wrapper alias, verify with a one-shot identity prompt, and mirror only sanitized reproducibility details. See `references/profile-backed-specialist-agents.md`. If Jared wants the agent contract to live in Obsidian, keep the canonical SOUL file in `/Users/jc/Desktop/Obsidian/Agents/` and symlink the profile's `SOUL.md` to it; see `references/profile-agent-obsidian-souls.md`. That reference also covers updating a parent agent's "Agent ecosystem" routing section when Jared introduces a new specialist agent, plus the safety check to strip inherited Telegram/gateway credentials from cloned profiles before they are used. When cleaning up an existing specialist ecosystem, promote rich profile-local SOUL files into Obsidian, back up older Obsidian copies before overwriting, remove stale duplicate profiles, and create/update `/Users/jc/Desktop/Obsidian/Agents/Agent Registry.md`; see `references/specialist-agent-governance-cleanup.md`. When the Obsidian Agents folder accumulates duplicate SOUL files, fork files, and non-SOUL clutter from Claude, use the cleanup workflow in `references/agent-vault-cleanup.md`. When auditing a new or revised SOUL before deployment, run the four-point checklist (consultation realism, internal contradictions, stale file paths, redundancy); see `references/soul-file-review-checklist.md`. When wiring a specialist profile to a design or product MCP server, add the server under that profile's `mcp_servers`, keep secrets in the profile `.env`, then restart the profile gateway; for Google Stitch/design-source workflows see the `native-mcp` skill reference `references/profile-design-mcp-stitch.md`. When Jared corrects a specialist's output format, patch the canonical SOUL with a concrete pre-send quality gate, verify an exemplar output, and restart the profile gateway; see `references/specialist-agent-output-quality-gates.md`. When Jared corrects a specialist agent's deliverable format, patch the canonical SOUL's response/output contract and restart the profile gateway; see `references/specialist-agent-output-contracts.md` for the decision-prep document pattern.

When deciding whether the machine can safely support another always-on profile gateway, measure live macOS memory pressure, swap, compression, `hermes profile list`, and per-gateway RSS before advising. Literal `unused` RAM can be low while the system is still healthy if swap is 0 and pressure is acceptable. See `references/profile-gateway-capacity.md`.

When migrating Hermes from one Mac to another (e.g. MacBook Air to Mac mini), use the full prep checklist: snapshot current state, confirm destination specs, decide what transfers vs what gets set up fresh, and verify the two-user privacy guard. See `references/macos-machine-migration-prep.md`.

If Hermes feels slow because too many specialist profile gateways are live, use the quick load-shedding workflow in `references/profile-gateway-load-shedding.md`: inspect `hermes profile list`, stop non-essential profiles with `hermes --profile <name> gateway stop`, and re-enable only the lane currently in use.

If Jared wants each specialist agent to save its SOUL and custom skills to GitHub, start with **mirror-only per-agent repos**, not GitHub as source of truth. Mirror only the durable identity layer: `SOUL.md`, agent-specific custom skills, and light docs. Do not mirror full profile folders, sessions, logs, memories, caches, `.env`, auth, or runtime state. Recommended pattern: one private repo per agent, a manifest-driven sync script that copies only custom skill deltas versus the global skills library, and a silent cron job that commits and pushes only when changes exist. See `references/per-agent-github-mirrors.md`.

If Jared keeps a better skill version in Obsidian and wants a specialist to use it now, replace the live Hermes skill from the Obsidian note, keep a timestamped backup of the old `SKILL.md`, verify the replacement, and restart the relevant profile gateway. See `references/obsidian-authored-skills.md`.

If each specialist agent should have its own Telegram bot, configure the bot token in that profile's own `.env`, verify it with Telegram `getMe`, restrict it with `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`, and start that profile's gateway service. Do not reuse the same Telegram token across multiple running profiles. If the token exists only in the default Hermes `.env`, the specialist bot will stay silent because the profile gateway cannot see its own bot credentials. After first contact, `/sethome` is a normal setup prompt, not a failure. See `references/profile-telegram-bots.md`.

When changing the whole agent stack's model/provider, use the guarded migration flow in `references/profile-model-migration-and-provider-cleanup.md`: verify model access first, update provider and model together, restart gateways/handlers, run direct profile probes, and grep configs/auth for stale provider references. For silent new bots, profile-name mismatches, stale CLI flags, Markdown send failures, and custom-handler fallbacks, see `references/profile-telegram-bot-troubleshooting.md`.

Full enumeration lives in `toolsets.py` as the `TOOLSETS` dict; `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` is the default bundle most platforms inherit from.

Tool changes take effect on `/reset` (new session). They do NOT apply mid-conversation to preserve prompt caching.

---

## Security & Privacy Toggles

Common "why is Hermes doing X to my output / tool calls / commands?" toggles — and the exact commands to change them. Most of these need a fresh session (`/reset` in chat, or start a new `hermes` invocation) because they're read once at startup.

### Secret redaction in tool output

Secret redaction is **off by default** — tool output (terminal stdout, `read_file`, web content, subagent summaries, etc.) passes through unmodified. If the user wants Hermes to auto-mask strings that look like API keys, tokens, and secrets before they enter the conversation context and logs:

```bash
hermes config set security.redact_secrets true       # enable globally
```

**Restart required.** `security.redact_secrets` is snapshotted at import time — toggling it mid-session (e.g. via `export HERMES_REDACT_SECRETS=true` from a tool call) will NOT take effect for the running process. Tell the user to run `hermes config set security.redact_secrets true` in a terminal, then start a new session. This is deliberate — it prevents an LLM from flipping the toggle on itself mid-task.

Disable again with:
```bash
hermes config set security.redact_secrets false
```

### PII redaction in gateway messages

Separate from secret redaction. When enabled, the gateway hashes user IDs and strips phone numbers from the session context before it reaches the model:

```bash
hermes config set privacy.redact_pii true    # enable
hermes config set privacy.redact_pii false   # disable (default)
```

### Command approval prompts

By default (`approvals.mode: manual`), Hermes prompts the user before running shell commands flagged as destructive (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, etc.). The modes are:

- `manual` — always prompt (default)
- `smart` — use an auxiliary LLM to auto-approve low-risk commands, prompt on high-risk
- `off` — skip all approval prompts (equivalent to `--yolo`)

```bash
hermes config set approvals.mode smart       # recommended middle ground
hermes config set approvals.mode off         # bypass everything (not recommended)
```

Per-invocation bypass without changing config:
- `hermes --yolo …`
- `export HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1`

Note: YOLO / `approvals.mode: off` does NOT turn off secret redaction. They are independent.

### Shell hooks allowlist

Some shell-hook integrations require explicit allowlisting before they fire. Managed via `~/.hermes/shell-hooks-allowlist.json` — prompted interactively the first time a hook wants to run.

### Disabling the web/browser/image-gen tools

To keep the model away from network or media tools entirely, open `hermes tools` and toggle per-platform. Takes effect on next session (`/reset`). See the Tools & Skills section above.

## Voice & Transcription

### STT (Voice → Text)

Voice messages from messaging platforms are auto-transcribed.

Provider priority (auto-detected):
1. **Local faster-whisper** — free, no API key: `pip install faster-whisper`
2. **Groq Whisper** — free tier: set `GROQ_API_KEY`
3. **OpenAI Whisper** — paid: set `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`
4. **Mistral Voxtral** — set `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

Config:
```yaml
stt:
  enabled: true
  provider: local        # local, groq, openai, mistral
  local:
    model: base          # tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
```

### TTS (Text → Voice)

| Provider | Env var | Free? |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Edge TTS | None | Yes (default) |
| ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Free tier |
| OpenAI | `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` | Paid |
| MiniMax | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Paid |
| Mistral (Voxtral) | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Paid |
| NeuTTS (local) | None (`pip install neutts[all]` + `espeak-ng`) | Free |

Voice commands: `/voice on` (voice-to-voice), `/voice tts` (always voice), `/voice off`.

## Spawning Additional Hermes Instances

Run additional Hermes processes as fully independent subprocesses — separate sessions, tools, and environments.

### When to Use This vs delegate_task

| | `delegate_task` | Spawning `hermes` process |
|-|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Isolation | Separate conversation, shared process | Fully independent process |
| Duration | Minutes (bounded by parent loop) | Hours/days |
| Tool access | Subset of parent's tools | Full tool access |
| Interactive | No | Yes (PTY mode) |
| Use case | Quick parallel subtasks | Long autonomous missions |

### One-Shot Mode

```
terminal(command="hermes chat -q 'Research GRPO papers and write summary to ~/research/grpo.md'", timeout=300)

# Background for long tasks:
terminal(command="hermes chat -q 'Set up CI/CD for ~/myapp'", background=true)
```

### Interactive PTY Mode (via tmux)

Hermes uses prompt_toolkit, which requires a real terminal. Use tmux for interactive spawning:

```
# Start
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s agent1 -x 120 -y 40 'hermes'", timeout=10)

# Wait for startup, then send a message
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t agent1 'Build a FastAPI auth service' Enter", timeout=15)

# Read output
terminal(command="sleep 20 && tmux capture-pane -t agent1 -p", timeout=5)

# Send follow-up
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t agent1 'Add rate limiting middleware' Enter", timeout=5)

# Exit
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t agent1 '/exit' Enter && sleep 2 && tmux kill-session -t agent1", timeout=10)
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```
# Agent A: backend
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s backend -x 120 -y 40 'hermes -w'", timeout=10)
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t backend 'Build REST API for user management' Enter", timeout=15)

# Agent B: frontend
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s frontend -x 120 -y 40 'hermes -w'", timeout=10)
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t frontend 'Build React dashboard for user management' Enter", timeout=15)

# Check progress, relay context between them
terminal(command="tmux capture-pane -t backend -p | tail -30", timeout=5)
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t frontend 'Here is the API schema from the backend agent: ...' Enter", timeout=5)
```

### Session Resume

```
# Resume most recent session
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s resumed 'hermes --continue'", timeout=10)

# Resume specific session
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s resumed 'hermes --resume 20260225_143052_a1b2c3'", timeout=10)
```

### Tips

- **Prefer `delegate_task` for quick subtasks** — less overhead than spawning a full process
- **Use terminal CLI for multi-agent pipelines** — Brock can chain specialist agents via `hermes --profile <name> chat -q "..." --quiet` without copy-paste. See `references/cross-agent-orchestration.md`.
- **Use `-w` (worktree mode)** when spawning agents that edit code — prevents git conflicts
- **Set timeouts** for one-shot mode — complex tasks can take 5-10 minutes
- **Use `hermes chat -q` for fire-and-forget** — no PTY needed
- **Use tmux for interactive sessions** — raw PTY mode has `\r` vs `\n` issues with prompt_toolkit
- **For scheduled tasks**, use the `cronjob` tool instead of spawning — handles delivery and retry

---

## Durable & Background Systems

Four systems run alongside the main conversation loop. Quick reference
here; full developer notes live in `AGENTS.md`, user-facing docs under
`website/docs/user-guide/features/`.

### Delegation (`delegate_task`)

Synchronous subagent spawn — the parent waits for the child's summary
before continuing its own loop. Isolated context + terminal session.

- **Single:** `delegate_task(goal, context, toolsets)`.
- **Batch:** `delegate_task(tasks=[{goal, ...}, ...])` runs children in
  parallel, capped by `delegation.max_concurrent_children` (default 3).
- **Roles:** `leaf` (default; cannot re-delegate) vs `orchestrator`
  (can spawn its own workers, bounded by `delegation.max_spawn_depth`).
- **Not durable.** If the parent is interrupted, the child is
  cancelled. For work that must outlive the turn, use `cronjob` or
  `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)`.

Config: `delegation.*` in `config.yaml`.

### Cron (scheduled jobs)

Durable scheduler — `cron/jobs.py` + `cron/scheduler.py`. Drive it via
the `cronjob` tool, the `hermes cron` CLI (`list`, `add`, `edit`,
`pause`, `resume`, `run`, `remove`), or the `/cron` slash command.

- **Schedules:** duration (`"30m"`, `"2h"`), "every" phrase
  (`"every monday 9am"`), 5-field cron (`"0 9 * * *"`), or ISO timestamp.
- **Per-job knobs:** `skills`, `model`/`provider` override, `script`
  (pre-run data collection; `no_agent=True` makes the script the whole
  job), `context_from` (chain job A's output into job B), `workdir`
  (run in a specific dir with its `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` loaded),
  multi-platform delivery.
- **Invariants:** 3-minute hard interrupt per run, `.tick.lock` file
  prevents duplicate ticks across processes, cron sessions pass
  `skip_memory=True` by default, and cron deliveries are framed with a
  header/footer instead of being mirrored into the target gateway
  session (keeps role alternation intact).

User docs: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron

### Curator (skill lifecycle)

Background maintenance for agent-created skills. Tracks usage, marks
idle skills stale, archives stale ones, keeps a pre-run tar.gz backup
so nothing is lost.

- **CLI:** `hermes curator <verb>` — `status`, `run`, `pause`, `resume`,
  `pin`, `unpin`, `archive`, `restore`, `prune`, `backup`, `rollback`.
- **Slash:** `/curator <subcommand>` mirrors the CLI.
- **Scope:** only touches skills with `created_by: "agent"` provenance.
  Bundled + hub-installed skills are off-limits. **Never deletes** —
  max destructive action is archive. Pinned skills are exempt from
  every auto-transition and every LLM review pass.
- **Telemetry:** sidecar at `~/.hermes/skills/.usage.json` holds
  per-skill `use_count`, `view_count`, `patch_count`,
  `last_activity_at`, `state`, `pinned`.

Config: `curator.*` (`enabled`, `interval_hours`, `min_idle_hours`,
`stale_after_days`, `archive_after_days`, `backup.*`).
User docs: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/curator

### Kanban (multi-agent work queue)

Durable SQLite board for multi-profile / multi-worker collaboration.
Users drive it via `hermes kanban <verb>`; dispatcher-spawned workers
see a focused `kanban_*` toolset gated by `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` so the
schema footprint is zero outside worker processes.

- **CLI verbs (common):** `init`, `create`, `list` (alias `ls`),
  `show`, `assign`, `link`, `unlink`, `comment`, `complete`, `block`,
  `unblock`, `archive`, `tail`. Less common: `watch`, `stats`, `runs`,
  `log`, `dispatch`, `daemon`, `gc`.
- **Worker toolset:** `kanban_show`, `kanban_complete`, `kanban_block`,
  `kanban_heartbeat`, `kanban_comment`, `kanban_create`, `kanban_link`.
- **Dispatcher** runs inside the gateway by default
  (`kanban.dispatch_in_gateway: true`) — reclaims stale claims,
  promotes ready tasks, atomically claims, spawns assigned profiles.
  Auto-blocks a task after ~5 consecutive spawn failures.
- **Isolation:** board is the hard boundary (workers get
  `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` pinned in env); tenant is a soft namespace
  within a board for workspace-path + memory-key isolation.

## Windows-Specific Quirks

Hermes runs natively on Windows (PowerShell, cmd, Windows Terminal, git-bash
mintty, VS Code integrated terminal). Most of it just works, but a handful
of differences between Win32 and POSIX have bitten us — document new ones
here as you hit them so the next person (or the next session) doesn't
rediscover them from scratch.

### Input / Keybindings

**Alt+Enter doesn't insert a newline.** Windows Terminal intercepts Alt+Enter
at the terminal layer to toggle fullscreen — the keystroke never reaches
prompt_toolkit. Use **Ctrl+Enter** instead. Windows Terminal delivers
Ctrl+Enter as LF (`c-j`), distinct from plain Enter (`c-m` / CR), and the
CLI binds `c-j` to newline insertion on `win32` only (see
`_bind_prompt_submit_keys` + the Windows-only `c-j` binding in `cli.py`).
Side effect: the raw Ctrl+J keystroke also inserts a newline on Windows —
unavoidable, because Windows Terminal collapses Ctrl+Enter and Ctrl+J to
the same keycode at the Win32 console API layer. No conflicting binding
existed for Ctrl+J on Windows, so this is a harmless side effect.

mintty / git-bash behaves the same (fullscreen on Alt+Enter) unless you
disable Alt+Fn shortcuts in Options → Keys. Easier to just use Ctrl+Enter.

**Diagnosing keybindings.** Run `python scripts/keystroke_diagnostic.py`
(repo root) to see exactly how prompt_toolkit identifies each keystroke
in the current terminal. Answers questions like "does Shift+Enter come
through as a distinct key?" (almost never — most terminals collapse it
to plain Enter) or "what byte sequence is my terminal sending for
Ctrl+Enter?" This is how the Ctrl+Enter = c-j fact was established.

### Config / Files

**HTTP 400 "No models provided" on first run.** `config.yaml` was saved
with a UTF-8 BOM (common when Windows apps write it). Re-save as UTF-8
without BOM. `hermes config edit` writes without BOM; manual edits in
Notepad are the usual culprit.

### `execute_code` / Sandbox

**WinError 10106** ("The requested service provider could not be loaded
or initialized") from the sandbox child process — it can't create an
`AF_INET` socket, so the loopback-TCP RPC fallback fails before
`connect()`. Root cause is usually **not** a broken Winsock LSP; it's
Hermes's own env scrubber dropping `SYSTEMROOT` / `WINDIR` / `COMSPEC`
from the child env. Python's `socket` module needs `SYSTEMROOT` to locate
`mswsock.dll`. Fixed via the `_WINDOWS_ESSENTIAL_ENV_VARS` allowlist in
`tools/code_execution_tool.py`. If you still hit it, echo `os.environ`
inside an `execute_code` block to confirm `SYSTEMROOT` is set. Full
diagnostic recipe in `references/execute-code-sandbox-env-windows.md`.

### Testing / Contributing

**`scripts/run_tests.sh` doesn't work as-is on Windows** — it looks for
POSIX venv layouts (`.venv/bin/activate`). The Hermes-installed venv at
`venv/Scripts/` has no pip or pytest either (stripped for install size).
Workaround: install `pytest + pytest-xdist + pyyaml` into a system Python
3.11 user site, then invoke pytest directly with `PYTHONPATH` set:

```bash
"/c/Program Files/Python311/python" -m pip install --user pytest pytest-xdist pyyaml
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
"/c/Program Files/Python311/python" -m pytest tests/foo/test_bar.py -v --tb=short -n 0
```

Use `-n 0`, not `-n 4` — `pyproject.toml`'s default `addopts` already
includes `-n`, and the wrapper's CI-parity guarantees don't apply off POSIX.

**POSIX-only tests need skip guards.** Common markers already in the codebase:
- Symlinks — elevated privileges on Windows
- `0o600` file modes — POSIX mode bits not enforced on NTFS by default
- `signal.SIGALRM` — Unix-only (see `tests/conftest.py::_enforce_test_timeout`)
- Winsock / Windows-specific regressions — `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform != "win32", ...)`

Use the existing skip-pattern style (`sys.platform == "win32"` or
`sys.platform.startswith("win")`) to stay consistent with the rest of the
suite.

### Path / Filesystem

**Line endings.** Git may warn `LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time
Git touches it`. Cosmetic — the repo's `.gitattributes` normalizes. Don't
let editors auto-convert committed POSIX-newline files to CRLF.

**Forward slashes work almost everywhere.** `C:/Users/...` is accepted by
every Hermes tool and most Windows APIs. Prefer forward slashes in code
and logs — avoids shell-escaping backslashes in bash.

## Troubleshooting

### Voice not working
1. Check `stt.enabled: true` in config.yaml
2. Verify provider: `pip install faster-whisper` or set API key
3. In gateway: `/restart`. In CLI: exit and relaunch.

### Tool not available
1. `hermes tools` — check if toolset is enabled for your platform
2. Some tools need env vars (check `.env`)
3. `/reset` after enabling tools

### Model/provider issues
1. `hermes doctor` — check config and dependencies
2. `hermes login` — re-authenticate OAuth providers
3. Check `.env` has the right API key
4. **Copilot 403**: `gh auth login` tokens do NOT work for Copilot API. You must use the Copilot-specific OAuth device code flow via `hermes model` → GitHub Copilot.

### Changes not taking effect
- **Tools/skills:** `/reset` starts a new session with updated toolset
- **Config changes:** In gateway: `/restart`. In CLI: exit and relaunch.
- **Code changes:** Restart the CLI or gateway process

### Skills not showing
1. `hermes skills list` — verify installed
2. `hermes skills config` — check platform enablement
3. Load explicitly: `/skill name` or `hermes -s name`

### Gateway issues
Check logs first:
```bash
grep -i "failed to send\|error" ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log | tail -20
```

Common gateway problems:
- **Gateway dies on SSH logout**: Enable linger: `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
- **Gateway dies on WSL2 close**: WSL2 requires `systemd=true` in `/etc/wsl.conf` for systemd services to work. Without it, gateway falls back to `nohup` (dies when session closes).
- **Gateway crash loop**: Reset the failed state: `systemctl --user reset-failed hermes-gateway`

### Email verification reality check

`hermes status --all` showing **Email: configured** only proves the platform is wired into Hermes. It does **not** prove a working send path.

For a real email-health check, verify the active backend explicitly:

1. **Direct Gmail / Google Workspace path**
   - Run the Google Workspace auth check:
     ```bash
     python ${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/productivity/google-workspace/scripts/setup.py --check
     ```
   - `AUTHENTICATED` means the Gmail OAuth token exists.
   - `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` means Hermes cannot send via the direct Google Workspace path yet, even if `hermes status --all` says Email is configured.

2. **Zapier MCP email path**
   - If email is expected to flow through Zapier MCP, test the bridge itself, for example:
     ```bash
     npx -y mcporter --config /Users/jc/config/mcporter.json list zapier --schema
     ```
   - If Zapier returns `Token expired - please re-authenticate`, fix it with:
     ```bash
     mcporter auth zapier
     ```

3. **Email platform IMAP/SMTP is a third, separate path**
   - `hermes setup` can configure the Email messaging platform with `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_IMAP_HOST`, and `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`.
   - When this is configured, `hermes status --all` may correctly show **Email: configured** and the gateway can use that mailbox.
   - This does **not** mean Google Workspace OAuth is connected. It only proves the IMAP/SMTP email platform is configured.

4. **Only claim a specific email path is working after that path is proven**
   - Google Workspace path: successful `setup.py --check` plus the needed Gmail API capability
   - Zapier MCP path: healthy Zapier connection plus the required Gmail action availability
   - Email platform path: Hermes Email configured in `hermes setup` and, ideally, a real receive/send or receive-only verification for that mailbox

Pitfall: do not collapse these paths together. `hermes status --all` can show **Email: configured** because IMAP/SMTP is set up while Google Workspace OAuth and Zapier Gmail are still unusable.

### Platform-specific issues
- **Discord bot silent**: Must enable **Message Content Intent** in Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents.
- **Slack bot only works in DMs**: Must subscribe to `message.channels` event. Without it, the bot ignores public channels.
- **Windows-specific issues** (`Alt+Enter` newline, WinError 10106, UTF-8 BOM config, test suite, line endings): see the dedicated **Windows-Specific Quirks** section above.

### Auxiliary models not working
If `auxiliary` tasks (vision, compression, session_search) fail silently, the `auto` provider can't find a backend. Either set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or explicitly configure each auxiliary task's provider:
```bash
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.provider <your_provider>
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.model <model_name>
```

```

Config: `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (settings), `~/.hermes/.env` (API keys).

### Adding a Tool (3 files)

**1. Create `tools/your_tool.py`:**
```python
import json, os
from tools.registry import registry

def check_requirements() -> bool:
    return bool(os.getenv("EXAMPLE_API_KEY"))

def example_tool(param: str, task_id: str = None) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"success": True, "data": "..."})

registry.register(
    name="example_tool",
    toolset="example",
    schema={"name": "example_tool", "description": "...", "parameters": {...}},
    handler=lambda args, **kw: example_tool(
        param=args.get("param", ""), task_id=kw.get("task_id")),
    check_fn=check_requirements,
    requires_env=["EXAMPLE_API_KEY"],
)
```

**2. Add to `toolsets.py`** → `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` list.

Auto-discovery: any `tools/*.py` file with a top-level `registry.register()` call is imported automatically — no manual list needed.

All handlers must return JSON strings. Use `get_hermes_home()` for paths, never hardcode `~/.hermes`.

### Adding a Slash Command

1. Add `CommandDef` to `COMMAND_REGISTRY` in `hermes_cli/commands.py`
2. Add handler in `cli.py` → `process_command()`
3. (Optional) Add gateway handler in `gateway/run.py`

All consumers (help text, autocomplete, Telegram menu, Slack mapping) derive from the central registry automatically.

### Agent Loop (High Level)

```
run_conversation():
  1. Build system prompt
  2. Loop while iterations < max:
     a. Call LLM (OpenAI-format messages + tool schemas)
     b. If tool_calls → dispatch each via handle_function_call() → append results → continue
     c. If text response → return
  3. Context compression triggers automatically near token limit
```

### Testing

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -o 'addopts=' -q   # Full suite
python -m pytest tests/tools/ -q            # Specific area
```

- Tests auto-redirect `HERMES_HOME` to temp dirs — never touch real `~/.hermes/`
- Run full suite before pushing any change
- Use `-o 'addopts='` to clear any baked-in pytest flags

**Windows contributors:** `scripts/run_tests.sh` currently looks for POSIX venvs (`.venv/bin/activate` / `venv/bin/activate`) and will error out on Windows where the layout is `venv/Scripts/activate` + `python.exe`. The Hermes-installed venv at `venv/Scripts/` also has no `pip` or `pytest` — it's stripped for end-user install size. Workaround: install pytest + pytest-xdist + pyyaml into a system Python 3.11 user site (`/c/Program Files/Python311/python -m pip install --user pytest pytest-xdist pyyaml`), then run tests directly:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
"/c/Program Files/Python311/python" -m pytest tests/tools/test_foo.py -v --tb=short -n 0
```

Use `-n 0` (not `-n 4`) because `pyproject.toml`'s default `addopts` already includes `-n`, and the wrapper's CI-parity story doesn't apply off-POSIX.

**Cross-platform test guards:** tests that use POSIX-only syscalls need a skip marker. Common ones already in the codebase:
- Symlink creation → `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32", reason="Symlinks require elevated privileges on Windows")` (see `tests/cron/test_cron_script.py`)
- POSIX file modes (0o600, etc.) → `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform.startswith("win"), reason="POSIX mode bits not enforced on Windows")` (see `tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_toctou_file_modes.py`)
- `signal.SIGALRM` → Unix-only (see `tests/conftest.py::_enforce_test_timeout`)
- Live Winsock / Windows-specific regression tests → `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform != "win32", reason="Windows-specific regression")`

**Monkeypatching `sys.platform` is not enough** when the code under test also calls `platform.system()` / `platform.release()` / `platform.mac_ver()`. Those functions re-read the real OS independently, so a test that sets `sys.platform = "linux"` on a Windows runner will still see `platform.system() == "Windows"` and route through the Windows branch. Patch all three together:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr(sys, "platform", "linux")
monkeypatch.setattr(platform, "system", lambda: "Linux")
monkeypatch.setattr(platform, "release", lambda: "6.8.0-generic")
```

See `tests/agent/test_prompt_builder.py::TestEnvironmentHints` for a worked example.

### Extending the system prompt's execution-environment block

Factual guidance about the host OS, user home, cwd, terminal backend, and shell (bash vs. PowerShell on Windows) is emitted from `agent/prompt_builder.py::build_environment_hints()`. This is also where the WSL hint and per-backend probe logic live. The convention:

- **Local terminal backend** → emit host info (OS, `$HOME`, cwd) + Windows-specific notes (hostname ≠ username, `terminal` uses bash not PowerShell).
- **Remote terminal backend** (anything in `_REMOTE_TERMINAL_BACKENDS`: `docker, singularity, modal, daytona, ssh, vercel_sandbox, managed_modal`) → **suppress** host info entirely and describe only the backend. A live `uname`/`whoami`/`pwd` probe runs inside the backend via `tools.environments.get_environment(...).execute(...)`, cached per process in `_BACKEND_PROBE_CACHE`, with a static fallback if the probe times out.
- **Key fact for prompt authoring:** when `TERMINAL_ENV != "local"`, *every* file tool (`read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search_files`) runs inside the backend container, not on the host. The system prompt must never describe the host in that case — the agent can't touch it.

Full design notes, the exact emitted strings, and testing pitfalls:
`references/prompt-builder-environment-hints.md`.

**Refactor-safety pattern (POSIX-equivalence guard):** when you extract inline logic into a helper that adds Windows/platform-specific behavior, keep a `_legacy_<name>` oracle function in the test file that's a verbatim copy of the old code, then parametrize-diff against it. Example: `tests/tools/test_code_execution_windows_env.py::TestPosixEquivalence`. This locks in the invariant that POSIX behavior is bit-for-bit identical and makes any future drift fail loudly with a clear diff.

### Commit Conventions

```
type: concise subject line

Optional body.
```

Types: `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`

### Key Rules

- **Never break prompt caching** — don't change context, tools, or system prompt mid-conversation
- **Message role alternation** — never two assistant or two user messages in a row
- Use `get_hermes_home()` from `hermes_constants` for all paths (profile-safe)
- Config values go in `config.yaml`, secrets go in `.env`
- New tools need a `check_fn` so they only appear when requirements are met
